# fantano-core

Hi everyone, Festsnusa's here. Hope you're doing well. I've been running an Anthony Fantano, aka The Needle Drop, fan page on [vk.com](https://vk.com/mbdtfisstill6), where I usually repost some Anthony's videos from the main channel, including some additional content, and make video transcriptions. And because nowadays vk.com belongs to Russian government, I have several restrictions on posting some videos, or just basically on stating my own opinion via comments (a slight resemblance of some agenda may affect my being as a russian citizen). Well, that's the reality we live in.

So, I've decided to continue posting on my little pet project. Here are some steps I completed in a nutshell:
-  I've scratched videos from the main channel;
-  Fetched Spotify and Apple Music album links via Spotify API and Apple Music Api respectfully;
-  Fetched album tags using LastFm API;
-  Fetched album images using LastFm API (I wanted to reveal album covers, which is not completed);
-  Used Ant Design for some styling;
-  Added filter methods to filter videos by year and by Anthony's score.

The complete action is available [here](dapper-cactus-c2ed7a.netlify.app)

Enjoy!
