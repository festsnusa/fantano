const e=`In case you don't know, Mogwai is a Glasgow band, they're one of the granddaddy's of the genre post-rock (one of my favorite genres of music). And after 6th studio LPs, tons of EPs and 15 years of being a band, I imagine it's hard not to want to mark all the progress that you've made in some way shape or form. And for me, compilations can get a little cheesy, to me they're almost like a band admitting that they have written music that's worth glossing over. But instead of going down that road, Mogwai has done one better and come out with this live album.\r

The sound on this live LP is fantastic. Though, there are a few moments, few flaws here and there when it gets really loud, distorted and extreme, it could sound a little flat, making everything drowned out. And every once in a while, it sounds almost as if Martin Bulloch, the drummer, is hitting not big resonant drums, but very tight, hard pieces of plastic. These are very, very minor flaws on the record.\r

There is a much bigger picture going on here, a much bigger, much more beautiful picture. The most impressive thing is that Mogwai has brought the dynamics, the loud, the soft, the tension, the very in-the-moment feel of their music to this live recording, like it was nobody's business. And that's no small task, we've all heard live recordings that are very bad. But here, everything translates so well, like on the track "2 Rights Make 1 Wrong" â€” the song, the music, the instrumentation, everything swells so beautifully. And another example on the track "Like Herod", they have so much control over their volume on this album. It's amazing they get so quiet before they finally explode into a frenzy of everything. Performance-wise, Mogwai are pretty straightforward on this thing, not doing reworked reinterpretations of these songs. These live versions are pretty close to the studio versions.\r

The only moments that I didn't really care for were the track "Cody", which, if you guys remember, is from Mogwai's second LP. The vocals on that live version were a little flat for me, weren't working, felt off. The other track that I didn't really care for "I Know You Are But What Am I?", but that's simply because I'm not really a fan of the Mogwai album "Happy Songs for Happy People".\r

"Special Moves" is a great document of all of the progress Mogwai has made up until this point and a show, or some proof, that Mogwai is going to be here for years.\r
