const e=`Ariel Pink is a multi-instrumentalist, a producer, a songwriter. He has been self recording music for years and in the process has pulled a massive amount of influence, from other amazing eccentric mastermind do-it-yourselfers like R. Stevie Moore. But genre wise, he also pulls quite a bit of influence from synthesizer pop and disco, hard rock, glam rock, rock and roll. Listening to Ariel Pink or an Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti Record is a lot like dining on a buffet of vintage rock and pop genres, but they're all fed through this kind of silly, playful and kind of eccentric lens. His music is occasionally really ridiculous, whether it be because of the tambour of some of the instrumentation or his vocals, or his lyrics, his melodies. Occasionally, even the cover art to his releases are kind of weird, but he backs up a lot of this oddball activity with legitimately good songwriting. Ariel Pink's music may be lo-fi, it may be difficult to digest for your average mainstream radio pop listener, but he has an incredible amount of personality and talent too, in my opinion. However, his last few albums have been a little bittersweet for me. His previous record “Mature Themes”, I did like this record overall, but for me the songs on this LP were far more straightforward than I am used to from Ariel — there were some tracks that were a little long-winded and kind of experimental, but the over-the-top personality just wasn't there for me on these tracks. And with the recording of these tracks not really being that lo fi or noisier, loaded with instrumentation, it kind of felt like Ariel's playful streak was kind of out to lunch on this record. And then, “Before Today”, which is Ariel's breakout album, his most successful record so far — I loved this record myself and I understand why other people might enjoy it too, but for someone who had been enjoying his music casually a few years prior it was kind of disappointing to hear a bunch of cleaned up versions of songs that he had already written and recorded on this album. So now, we have the album “Pom Pom”, which honestly, since I found out about Ariel Pink, is the record I have been waiting for him to release. It's loaded with new material or at least material that is is new to me. Aesthetically, it is lo fi, but it feels more detailed and dense than a lot of his older low fidelity material. But this album still maintains a strong pop sensibility in the way that before today and mature themes did. Plus, on many of these tracks we get Ariel Pink's eccentricity in full color, this is the kookiest he has sounded in years. We have legitimately great pop anthems on this record clashing with absurdist detours that have a sense of humor that rivals Zappa's. And there are other songs here the kind of land somewhere in the middle, like “Nude Beach a Go-Go”, or “Exile on Frog Street”.\r

This record kicks off with a bit of sunshine pop straight out of the 60's with a kind of freakish twist. I love the twinkly silly instrumentation on this record what sounds like a glockenspiel, some kind of crazy colorful synthesizers backing up those drums and guitars. The title of this track is “Plastic raincoats in the Pig Parade”, and lyrically to me the song is all about just flying your freak flag and not falling into conformity with the mannequins that he mentions on numerous occasions on this track, at least that's again how I interpret it, and to me that's a vibe, that's a theme that runs through many of the tracks here. Maybe that even plays into the title of this record, which again is “Pom pom”, pom pom being something that a cheerleader holds, somebody who is yelling, screaming, cheering something, on celebrating something. And this album is celebratory in a sense — it's bombastic, it's gregarious, especially with this opening track here that just has all these weird hard pans sound effects and instrumental bells and whistles popping up in every direction sort of like in a Revolver kind of sense.\r

And then, Ariel Pink is quick to change genres right on the very next track, as if this album were some kind of weird mixtape, whose origin and creator is completely unknown, but all the songs are completely fantastic. On the song “White Freckles” we get this smooth, lo-fi synthesizer, popped with a really great refrain and I'm not sure if you notice, but the song in many parts is actually in 7/8. Yet, the groove is fantastic and the song remains completely catchy. I love an artist that can make a song in an odd time signature, but just play it off as if it's just a normal everyday pop song.\r
\r
The song “4 Shadows” is kind of like a semi tongue-in-cheek fusion of gothic rock, old-school heavy metal and what sounds like an instrumental off of an old 80's, 90's Halloween novelty tape. Arial pink actually toys with metal riffs once again on the songs “Goth Bomb”. Or “Sexual Athletics”, which maybe is like the worst song on the entire record it just pulls riffs straight out of The Black Sabbath's playbook and just toys with it in a very silly way, it's obviously a bit of satire. The comedy sort of took precedent over the song being good. However, this is really the only moment on the record where this happens.\r
\r
Because in modern days, where pop music is designed to just appeal to as many people as quickly as possible and not engage them and not move them, we have the song “Lipstick”, which is a fantastic reminder that pop music can do more than just be radio fodder, or car commercial music. A sentiment that I think Ariel Pink has some fun with on the song “Jell-O”, which is kind of a satirical tongue-in-cheek jingle for the famous food product. And there are other fantastic pop songs on this record, like “Put Your Number in My Phone”, songs that are short, they're concise, they're lovely lyrically and melodically, but there are some longer tracks on here too, and these songs show that Ariel Pink can do a longer track and keep it engaging, as he introduces maybe new musical passages or interludes, solos or just changes up the track completely. Introducing an entirely new instrumental shift or even like some spoken word, or just vocal cuts of people who might be just building up the narrative of the story. Like on “Not Enough Violence”. Or “Dinosaur Carebears”, which opens up with this really weird foreign melody, it turns into a freakish piece of polka pop and then later down the line it seems to shift into like this The Police-esque reggae jam. And yet, it all just kind of works.\r
\r
We have the song “Black Ballerina”, which is sort of strange, kind of hilarious, features a very wimpy protagonist who falls in love with a exotic dancer. He only seems to have $10 on his person. It's kind of like listening to a funny lo-fi pop version of American Pie or Porky's. And with ballads like “One Summer Night”, which is this really charming piece of 50's pop, it's so clear that Ariel Pink is just so influenced by music from across the vintage pop spectrum and he just knows all the right ways to subvert it and just make it weird, make it odd. It's like he's taking all these old black-and-white photos of pop music and just coloring over them in pinks and neon greens, vibrant purples and sky blues and blood reds.\r
\r
And the closer on this album is absolutely heart-wrenching, just harrowing, it's such a powerful finish for this record, even without analyzing the lyrics, vocally and instrumentally it's such a melodically moving song. With over an hour of material on this album, this to me really feels like Ariel Pink's getting back to his roots, giving us tons of tracks — some of them weird detours, some of them diamonds in the rough, some of them visceral rockers, but now he's doing that with a stronger pop sensibility, a better recording, more detail and some really funny jokes.\r
