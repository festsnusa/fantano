const e=`Nicolas Jaar is a New York electronic music producer, he's been putting out EPs pretty regularly for the past several years. But this is the first I'm hearing of him with this debut full-length album. A needle drop of mine, you know who you are, ever since she introduced me to this I've been soaking it in, it's been taking a while for me to figure out how I feel about this, because it is a heavy piece of work. And it's hard to label this LP as being any one thing, this album is part minimalist, techno, part ambient soundscape, part sample-based sound collage, part field recording. What flavor you're getting depends on what track you're listening to. It's like a mixtape you might make for a really-really weird girl who you're attracted to. But still, even though there's a lot of variation among these songs, they all find a way to either blend or fade into one another, making this a cohesive listening experience.\r

For some standout moments, let me say Nicolas can twist some knobs here. Let's look at the title track, it seems like this song, along with a lot of songs on this LP, are hits, set for the planet's darkest dancefloors. You've got Nico's voice, or what I think is a Nico's voice, just mumbling, bouncing with echo and sounding deep and dark, and ominous. When the beat hits, it is like pure-pure ecstasy. Really fat, obese synthesizers and more and more rhythms popping up as the song progresses. More effects are coming up, the bass is swelling in the background, it reminds me of the atmosphere surrounding Matthew Dear's "Black City". And in another way, reminds me of Pantha Du Prince. In that on the surface it seems repetitive, minimal, but once you take the plunge and just dive your head into this thing, you see a lot more subtlety than you did the first time around. There are a few other tracks that follow this formula.\r

As far as other songs, like the intro, the outro, a bunch of tracks peppered in between, there are a lot of sample vocals and found sounds. Like weird clicks and textures of water, the sound of people laughing, talking, kids playing, mouth noises. It's all set to dark synthesizers or piano. But it's not like all the samples here just create these filler tracks that you're just going to breeze by when you actually get the album in your hands. There are a lot of spots here with horns and even the voices themselves that actually build the song, like on "I Got A". I mean, I hear this man's voice, it couldn't possibly be Nicolas's, it sounds like some blues man singing about his woman, but he takes this one section of him singing and repeats it over and over, while all this clipped instrumentation rises underneath it. It's fantastic how Nicolas basically takes these sounds and plays them like they're an instrument.\r

This album may come off as something that's trying to be too deep for you, too out there, too weird. But there are a lot of accessible and beautiful and gorgeous moments here. It's just that many of them, I would say maybe all of them, do not hit right away. Plus, this LP isn't exactly straightforward with what its intent is. Even after all the times I've heard it, I'm not even sure what the point is. All I know is that I'm enjoying it, I'm hit by a lot of great grooves here, I love the synthesizers, the textures that flow throughout this album. I'm finding a lot of haunting melodies, a lot of great and creative uses of samples and a really, really dark atmosphere. It gets repetitive in the end, especially when you start hearing a lot of the voices that you heard in the beginning used over. Plus, I wish there were a few more moments here, like the title track.\r
