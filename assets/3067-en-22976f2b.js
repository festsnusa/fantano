const e=`Singer-songwriter FKA Twigs, she's back, new album. Finally following up her groundbreaking contribution to the world of alternative R&B “LP1” back in 2014. It's been 5 years and even though Twigs hasn't spent the entirety of that time silent, listeners have been in the dark long enough to not really know where she's going to take her next record. And the experimental R&B wave that Twigs originally wrote in on is kind of gone at this point. Not to say the sound and influence isn't still there, it's just that it's given away to so many other things. Now, honestly I can't say I was too excited to give this new Twigs album a listen. Mostly because I found some of the bigger teaser tracks to this record to be underwhelming or unlikable. The track “holy terrain” featuring Future just feels like a really awkward attempt at a commercial crossover. And with loads of producers on it, even though the beat doesn't sound that varied. The Future placements and ad-libs just are not necessary. And the guy's performance on the track is average at best, you would think that since Future is being given such an unlikely placement on this track he would pull out all the stops, but no. I do like some passages of the instrumental on this track, I do like Twigs' vocal performance, even though some of the vocal melodies feel muddled in the overly wordy lyrics.\r
\r
And then, we have the track “home with you”, which had so much potential, with its experimental instrumentation, with its Radiohead-ish piano chords, but the way Twigs vocals are treated on this track, the way they're processed, the effects laid onto them, it's terrible. It's so grating and so distorted. Is there a chorus on this too? It's hideous. Beyond the effects, I like that it sounds as if Twigs is trying to be more expressive vocally on this project, but I just can't stand a listen to this. What's worse is the track works in multiple parts and none of those parts seem to come together, they neither segue into each other effectively or they just end abruptly and then give way to a new part. By the time the thing ends, it's so unfulfilled, hollow, it's built up little to no momentum even off the parts that are likable. Like, that one passage with the gorgeous swell of woodwinds and synth bass. It's so odd, this is the only track that uses vocal effects this heavily and the only track structurally that just seems like a total mess.\r
\r
I guess I'm happy that's the case, because nearly every other track on this thing is good too great. The only other major issues I have with the project honestly is “cellophane”, which I loved as a teaser, but as a closing track it just feels so anticlimactic. I mean, what I love about the track is it's so unbearably tragic, with its sombre pianos and its hushed heartbroken vocals, those refrains throughout the track. But even though I love the tune, love the lyrics, love many passages of this song, it has a non ending, which leaves the finish of this album feeling very hollow. And the flow of the record for me instrumentally and narratively is not really anything to freak out about either.\r
\r
I think you could arrange these tracks in a few different ways and basically get the same results. I mean, don't get me wrong, “thousand eyes” is very distinctly an opener, with a lot of very mystical curious and shy vocals and instrumentation really lures you in. It doesn't give too much away, it makes you want more, it's the ultimate art pop tease. After a great tone setting intro, the very disorienting “home with you” isn't the best contrast — the very sleepy and repetitive, but slowly swelling “daybed” toward the end of the record doesn't fit all that nicely up against one of the other quietest songs on the album, the closer, either.\r
\r
I do like the contrast presented in a lot of the lyrics on this track though. At least in isolation I think most of the songs on this record are enjoyable. The song “sad day” is a gorgeous track for Twigs with a very clear stylistic pivot. Twigs very much moves away on this track from those subverted R&B grooves and chords off of “LP1” and she is firmly housed with an art pop territory right now. And pulling from some very specific and obvious places too, mostly Kate Bush. The sound palette on “sad day” may be cold, futurustic and dark, but the vocals are Kate Bush all the way — that vibrato, that regal, but light tone, Twigs also really laying on her English accent. And the Kate Bush worship on this record isn't entirely a bad thing. I think Twigs embodies the influence well, even if I think it makes this record a tad bit less original than “LP1”. And even if there is a bit of vocal overlap here and there, I think Twigs arrives at a lot of very different artistic conclusions than Bush ever did instrumentally, songwriting wise, lyrically. For example, this track features all of these glitchy, noisy, twittering passages of percussion and electronic instrumentation, a lot of really cool progressions too.\r
\r
The Kate Bush worship continues on to the track “mary magdalene” as well, although after a somewhat Laurie Anderson inspired intro, with a very bare and robotic vocal intro that is reminiscent of “Oh Superman”. What's to come after this though is one of the most powerful moments on the entire record, not only because of Twigs very dynamic vocal performance, but also because of the beautiful, dynamic, well-structured and ever-evolving instrumental here. The lyrics are also pretty high impact as Twigs gets more conceptual here than she is at any other point on the project, with her words dealing directly in the perception of in the nature of women, using Mary Magdalene story and history to explore these themes in a very smart way. Later, I'm loving the tracks psychedelic vocal effects, as well as IDM inspired instrumental passages, it is very Bjork. But still, tasteful.\r
\r
Meanwhile, the track “fallen alien” is a legitimate banger and maybe the most out-there track on the entire record, if not only for its bright chilling and sharp chorus samples and fat bass hits, which kind of sound like something from Kanye's “Yeezus”. Twigs' vocals at the intro of the song are so freaky and stiff, really embody the feel of an alien trying to emote on a human level. But the singing lets loose and when I say lets loose she is borderline shrieking on this track. Her vocals, the instrumental give off this supremely sinister vibe that I love. I don't think FKA Twigs has proven herself on this album to be the most skilled vocalist. I think a lot of her appeal comes down to weird breathy gimmicks and strange vocalizations, but still she comes off incredibly expressive and very out there on this record, in a way that is compelling, beautiful, intriguing.\r
\r
The song “mirrored heart” is another highlight for me, it sets a very bittersweet song against some somewhat awkward, clunky instrumentation. But the lyrics and the writing at the core of all of it are so beautiful and so great that they shine through all the weird bits of sound orbiting it. And how again clunky all of it sounds becomes kind of a selling point, a unique characteristic. Some of Twiggs' best material so far is on “Magdalene”, no doubt about that. For sure, that's what's feeling a great deal of the hype behind this new album. Which honestly is mostly justified, I like it. But is it Twigs most consistent record so far? No. Is it one of the most enigmatic or groundbreaking art pop records of the decade? Not really. As special and as stunning as some of the vocals here are, as respectable as the updates on the forms of Bjork and Kate Bush are. There are some real duds in this tracklist here. And again, not that crazy about the flow. There are a lot of great individual tracks here, but as an album, I don't really think this thing is greater than the some of its parts.\r
