const e=`This is 2005's record from UK rapper, producer, singer, songwriter, multimedia artist, political activist M.I.A.. In my opinion, she is one of the most daring artists of the 2000s, whether you're talking about the quirky electro pop stylings of Kero Kero Bonito or even the industrial hip-hop bangers of Death Grips, or cultural melting pot indies, such as Tune Yards, even viral e-girl rappers on Youtube. M.I.A. was ahead of all of it while it. May be tough to make the case that she's the best artist of the 2000s, she certainly wrote some of the most predictive music to come out in the last 15 years. Even as we transition into 2021, “Arular” still sounds like a project that could drop a month from now and still sound current. In fact, I think this record and its follow-up “Kala” sound more relevant now than they ever have, because at the time that this dropped nobody was sounding like this. And what's even more incredible is that M.I.A. lived to actually record and release this project. I won't go into too many details here as some of them are quite harrowing and they're all readily available online for anyone who wants to read. But much of her youth after being born in London was spent back in Sri Lanka, where her father worked as an activist in a civil war that would end up displacing her family for quite a long time. With her mother, M.I.A. was eventually able to go back to England which put her in a position to go to art school studying fine art and video. This put her on a trajectory to become a filmmaker, but eventually her talents had her crossover into the music scene and that drew her to a different path that would lead to all of the demo tracking and the release of a 2004 mixtape that would set the stage for this album. Much of “Arular” does sound like a brick to the face, but don't let that distract from the fact that M.I.A. stylistically here pulls off an amazing balancing act. Finding ways to tie together all these unlikely sounds masterfully and methodically. To put it as simply as I can, this record sounds like an explosive clash of glitchy electro pop, populist dance hall, booming Miami bass, uncompromising synth punk, UK hip hop and a bit of brazilian favela funk too. And, of course all of this is attached to her unapologetically opinionated and also political lyricism, which occasionally pushes these tracks into the realm of protest music. I mean, if “pull up the people, pull up the poor, pull up the people, pull up the poor” is not a statement of protest, I don't know if it is. So, there are a lot of sounds and ideas flowing throughout this project, some of which are helped along with the production of Diplo, Cavemen or Richard X, but no matter who takes part in a given song it is painfully clear that it is M.I.A.'s vision that is guiding all of it because this record is so amazingly consistent. Absolutely, all of it is banging, raw, charming and intercontinental.\r

Now, back to “Pull Up the People”, which the first few bars of this track sonically are a great mission statement for this LP, because I love how dry and naked every single sound, every abrasive percussive hit, every base gurgle is. It really enhances the bold and in-your-face energy of this project. On top of it, there's absolutely nowhere for any blemishes on this record to hide. But in the case of M.I.A., I think this is just a show of rugged strength, as on the lyrical side of this track she compares herself to a soldier, a fighter, her beats are compared to bombs. That's certainly the case also for “Bucky Done Gun”, whose international electro grooves and hand drums sound like a sonic rush that really embodies some of the song's opening lyrics:\r
\r
“They're coming through the window\r
They're coming through the door\r
They're busting down the big wall\r
And sounding the horn”\r
This track sounds like a violent dance revolution set in either 1980s Miami or Rio de Janeiro.\r
\r
Things do tone down a little bit on the emotional side with “Sun Showers”, but sonically this track is as bold as any other here. The track is like a glitchy mutant piece of dancehall featuring this strangely chorused vocal on the hook that is essentially an interpolation of sun shower by Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, kind of a deep pull on that one but it sounds so foreign and also so obscure as M.I.A. is pulling it into her own song, it sounds original. And while, the groove and vocals on this track may be easy going M.I.A.'s lyrics actually dive into themes of violence and conflict, whether that be personal, systematic, or even discriminatory. M.I.A. also occasionally tossing in these catchy turns of phrase:\r
\r
“I bongo with my lingo\r
And beat it like a wing, yo\r
To Congo, to Colombo\r
Can't stereotype my thing, yo”\r
M.I.A. might not be the greatest rapper of this era from a technical or a wordplace standpoint, but there are few out there of this decade in my opinion, who used slang in syntax as creatively as she did, which allowed her to do so much with so little.\r
\r
Following, this we have the absolutely radical “Fire Fire”, whose lyrics literally depict gorillas training for war, firing at opposition from rooftops. Now, according to interviews, this track isn't trying to be overtly political, it's more of a take on the music industry failing to cater to more alternative tastes, which I would say was certainly the case in the 2000s. And so, if you don't give us what we want as an audience or as musicians we will make it, we will take it, we will create our own scene and if that's not a political statement, I don't really know it is. I mean, this track may not be literally about war, but the ethos M.I.A. is putting forward is certainly reflective of alternative cultures spread across the internet in a self-sustaining way.\r
\r
By comparison the track “Amazon” reads as a lot more literal. Given the strife M.I.A.'s family has gone through, one could most likely read this track as a meditation on getting lost in the haze of war or violence, even human trafficking maybe. Meanwhile, on the instrumental side we have this menagerie of sound effects that sound like they're straight out of the jungle, backed up with these electro-acoustic bits of percussion, it really transports me to the tense amazonian scene that is being set here. There's also the deliciously glitchy bingo, which is packed with all these revving squelching coarse synthesizers, which pair pretty interestingly with quite a bit of steel drum. I think it's also important to note this is one of many tracks on this project, where M.I.A. sports this really effortless amateurish charm, it's almost like a punk ethos type of thing. While, there's certainly a lot of intent behind what M.I.A. does and says on this project, they're simultaneously an element of “I'm gonna give the performance I'm gonna give, I'm gonna let the chips fall where they may. And overall, Ithink it just gives “Arular” this endearing messiness.\r
\r
Now, “Hombre”, I think I could describe only as a psychedelic piece of reggaeton with some South Asian influences worked in there very subtly. The track is also packed with one sexually explicit lyric after another. The track is fun, eccentric, absolutely scandalous and inadvertently it seems like M.I.A. created a Die Antwoord's sound for them on this song too, they should maybe send her a “thank you” note.\r
\r
Now, since this project is so solid from front to back in my view, we do lead into a strong finish from here. With the song “10 Dollar”, rhythmically I think the Miami bass vibes come back, the drum machine rhythms are incredible, it's an absolute firecracker of a beat. Then, the following “U.R.A.Q.T.” is a hilarious detour about a love triangle, where M.I.A. is essentially battling it out with this other woman over a guy and dropping some hilarious bars in the process, saying how her and this guy are tighter than J-Lo and her jeans and tighter than R Kelly in his teens. Also, the beat on this track is insane, it's wheezing and kind of hurting and jerking. Apparently, it samples the Sanford and Sun's theme, which is a pretty unlikely source, but still it does lead to this incredibly unique track.\r
\r
Then following this, we have “Galang”, which is essentially the closer before the hidden song on the record — yeah, back in the day, CDs, we did a lot of hidden tracks at the end of the CD. This track essentially was one of the original singles that kind of got M.I.A. off the ground, so it only makes sense it would make it onto this record. It's a little rougher in comparison with other tracks here, but it does embody a lot of the basic sonic and lyrical elements that made M.I.A.'s music around this time so special. Plus, the lyrics are pretty interesting and focused as well, essentially about staying safe in the midst of a lot of different contexts. Keeping your head down to duck either a shotgun shot or avoiding the feds trying to survive economically too, which is sort of an interesting message to leave this record off with because not only does it touch down on a lot of the themes of violence and war and injustice that informed much of M.I.A.'s work across her career, but also, while I'm sure she did need to keep her head down at multiple points to get to this place where she could release this record and move throughout the rest of her career, musically and artistically she has spent quite a bit of time not keeping her head down at all, really kind of being in people's faces and being bold and being unapologetic and being her marching to the beat of her own drum and sometimes absolutely getting in trouble for it, hurting her commercial prospects just so that she could just do things on her own terms.\r
\r
But ultimately, I think M.I.A. doing things in her own way is part of what makes her interesting and special and significant as an artist. And I hope that more people pay attention to her work or sort of realize the massive amount of influence that she's had over the years with records like this.\r
