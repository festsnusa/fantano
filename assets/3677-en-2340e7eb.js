const e=`This is the newest full-length LP from Lindsey Jordan's Snail Mail. The highly anticipated follow-up to her 2018 debut “Lush”, a record that was certainly high on energy and piss and vinegar, thanks to its raw, but approachable indie rock and pop tunes with a garagey twist not exactly distinct in terms of style and delivery, but still a solid debut nonetheless that had some decent highlights on it and it was pretty promising overall. Certainly, something that made you look forward to the follow-up and fast forward to 2021 and we are here, with the next full-length record.\r
\r
And I guess, I can say in this relatively short amount of time Snail Mail has creatively shown quite a bit of maturity, shifting away slightly from the simpler and rougher rock pallets on the last record and now heading into something that's a bit more ornate instrumentally, slower, smoother, moodier. Sometimes calling back to 90s singer-songwriter pop mainstays, such as Dido or Jewel. But delivered in a way where it still has an appeal that will resonate with a Mitski or a Lucy Dacus type audience. This new record is a different direction for Snail Mail, but the unfortunate fact is that even with this change Lindsey still feels no closer to hitting upon something that is all that distinct. Also, in the instance of a few tracks this new direction does expose some shortcomings as well vocally. On some of the most intimate cuts, such as “Light Blue” or “c. et al.”, Lindsey hits some very awkward notes in some rough and difficult vocal performances. I think her performatively angsty singing on these cuts gestures toward melodies that would hit a lot harder if her delivery was a bit more impassioned or engaging. Her singing style even leaves some of the more eventful songs on the record, feeling drab especially during the verses like the intro or “Headlock”. And this is despite Lindsey's lyrics having this potently obsessed and lovesick angle much of the time.\r
\r
Now, I wouldn't say this pretty short LP is completely devoid of highlights. “Ben Franklin” and “Forever (Sailing)” are certainly examples. Though part of the reason these cuts work in my opinion is that they have these wonderful instrumental flourishes that reinforce the melodies of these tracks. “Ben Franklin's” wheezy little synth leads on the hook certainly make that pop. Even Lindsey's breathy falsettos around the bridge point of the song are a treat. Then “Forever's” groovy sensual and low-key beats, as well as rhythm guitars, have a distinctly 80s feel to them. Which surprisingly is something that Lindsey plays pretty well into, not to mention that the the tune is pretty solid overall on this one.\r
\r
But look, unfortunately there are just as many moments on this thing that are profoundly uninspired. The song “Glory” for example sounds like a Phoebe Bridgers did a totally flat bland indie rock cut. And I appreciate that Lindsey is able to tie up the lost love narrative that this record has going in the final two songs of the LP, but the singing doesn't really rebound on these tracks either. Really, this whole narrative in Valentine's breakup concept is the best and most consistent thing and focus thing it has going for it, because outside of that like the singing is amiss, I suppose the production generally is ok and very clean and balanced, even if it doesn't really have much in terms of a personality, the songwriting is generally mid across the record.\r
\r
For sure, again, there are a couple of highlights that I appreciated, but even those cuts in the grander scheme of indie and pop and singer songwriter music I've heard this year are somewhat average. Like, “Ben Franklin” for as decent as it is would maybe be like a low light on a Mitski record, like listenable, but there's certainly more superior songs on the LP. Meanwhile on this record like this is some of the best it has to offer. I think a lot of this record if you're into this very soft and contemplative indie rock and singer songwriter style is listenable, but not much else.\r
