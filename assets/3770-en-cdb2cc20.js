const e=`This is a brand new LP from legendary West Coast funk and alt rock outfit, the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's been a while since their last full-length LP “The Getaway” in 2016, an LP I to this day struggle to conjure many memories of negative or positive, which is kind of the case in general for the 2010s when it comes to the Peps. Yeah, I'm calling them that the Peps. If anything the last 10 years have felt almost like a loss of direction for the band in a way. Their paths to LPs obviously weren't akin to the in your face funk metal that their breakout records brought to the table, nor did they really achieve the viral heights of their biggest pop rock crossovers in the late 90s and early 2000s. But now, we have a new record here with a new decade and the exciting announcement that guitarist, songwriter or multi-instrumentalist really John Frusciante is back in the mix with the band. Anybody familiar with the Pep's history knows that John was there during some of the most pivotal moments in the band's discography. So, that's got to be at least one reason to be excited for “Unlimited Love”. Which is a massive album, not the band's longest by far, but still a pretty hefty offering at 70 minutes or so. And for the most part, the 17 tracks here stick very closely to the band's trademark blend of funk laced alt rock. Albeit now a bit smoother and mellower. I mean, obviously there's no “Give It Away” on here, but there's still lots of grooves to be had. Acouple of metal inspired bridges and breaks too. Seems like the band isn't desperately vying for pop appeal this time around as well.\r
\r
I mean, “Black Summer” was the lead single to this thing, and now having heard the entire album, it's just about the catchiest cut you're gonna get on this record. I'm not catching a supreme amount of drive and focus across this project as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's as if the band this time around is doing just what feels good in the moment. For as long as they feel like it, I guess. And as somebody who's just listening to the record, there is something second-hand freeing about that. The Peps truly do have nothing to prove at this point, they're rock legends, one of the most popular to ever do it, as a bass player myself I regard Flea as one of the most influential bassists of all time.\r
\r
No matter how weak of a record this band ever puts out, that's always gonna be there in my heart somewhere, especially since as a 90s kid they were a part of my soundtrack as I was getting into music for the first time. Which is why it's slightly encouraging to hear the band in a bit more of a funkier place on some of these tracks this time around. And also hear them randomly venturing into stuff like the sci-fi synths and sliding guitar melodies that suddenly shifts into these grungy hard rock riffs on “Bastards of Light”. Or the country music transition toward the end of “White Braids & Pillow Chair”.\r
\r
There are also some really bold and jazzy trumpet layers toward the finish of “Aquatic Mouth Dance”, which is a phrase I hope I never have to say again, because it sounds like a one-way ticket to an STI. Having said that, I should move over to one of my biggest peeves with the record and that is the lyrics. Lord, I mean I'm well aware at this point that Anthony Kiedis has not exactly built up the reputation of a godly wordsmith or anything, but he does have a unique style that fuses elements of spoken word and singing and rapping — it's very dynamic, it's very punchy, and at this point I can't really imagine any other vocal style fronting the band, working in the context of the Pep's music. But still, there's no reason for some of the verses on this record to be as absurd and just straight up silly as they are. Like, “Aquatic Mouth Dance”, seriously, the band itself in the background is sounding absolutely sick on this track. I mean, melodically one of the better hooks on the entire LP, but Aquatic Mouth Dance? Which is just the tip of the iceberg, like the song “Here Ever After” for example, this is almost gobbledygook:\r
\r
“Peaches are sold and all givin' up on that Humpty style\r
At the Caldwell 'cross from blacktop\r
She's Eurasian, met her at the Quick Stop\r
We danced at Tito's Go-Go\r
Girlfriend's back, now she's gone solo”.\r
\r
She's Eurasian, she's from the largest continental landmass on the planet Earth? Yeah, her and billions of other people. Like, I'm not averse to the idea that what is going on in this song is based in some kind of story or experience, but it's like Anthony is consistently pulling from the most irrelevant and ridiculous details of the tale and assembling that into some kind of narrative jumble. What's even worse is the song “Poster Child”, which is packed with all these silly tongue twisters, making constant pop culture references, some of which are cute allusions to the idea of all this stuff and life itself being so temporary, but a lot of the time it's just\r
\r
“Bubble gum, I come bazooka, dirty dandy nana-looka\r
Smoke banana in your hookah, now I know the band is ruca”,\r
\r
this sounds like if “We Didn't Start the Fire” it was written by Dr. Seuss, but on an off day. Look, I'm not gonna belabor this point, but I think the lyrics across this record generally are weak. It feels rare that Anthony is actually delivering a cogent thoughts that assemble into something coherent at the end of it. Like when he sings about coming to terms with not being the person that someone he seems to have romantic feelings for needs in their life on the song “Not The One”. Or the story of star-crossed lovers on the track “It's Only Natural”. And keep in mind, both of these tracks are highlights for me on the record. But sometimes his bars just come across too fragmented or just too quick to throw out very low hanging fruit, like lyrical cliche after lyrical cliche or just be weirdly awkward:\r
\r
“Please, love, can I have a taste?\r
I just wanna lick your face\r
Any other day and I would say\r
You're Atlantis manta ray”.\r
\r
He also delivers over the track “One Way Traffic” with all of these very strange, white girl rap flows that are akin to that of like Rebecca Black on the song “Friday”.\r
\r
And it's moments like these that I think prevent the full potential of these tracks, even when the band in the background is just like totally kicking ass. Like on the song “These Are the Ways” or “Whatchu Thinkin'”, which does feature one of the better choruses on the entire LP, but like what is this flow where it just sounds like Kidis is ripping off or interpolating “Puttin' On The Ritz” [by Taco].\r
\r
So as I was saying on this record, it genuinely does come across that the band just doesn't have anything to prove at this point, that leads to some risks that are interesting and pan out, that leads to others where yeah not so much. “The Heavy Wing” for example is an attempt at this heavy, grungy, psych rock fusion and it has an easy going and melodic enough start, and on the course it breaks into some wildly noisy guitars that are really cathartic and exciting, definitely one of Frusciante's moments to shine on the project. But I believe he also takes on the chorus as well where the vocals get super buried. And frankly, this section of the song just kind of sounds like something that Red Hot Chili Peppers would have been a breath of fresh air from in the 90s. And I don't know why, but the drums, bass and guitar on “The Great Apes” come across so much more amateurish than they do on any other track here. The drum beat seems so plainly straightforward, the bass triads are bland, the blaring guitar chords that ham-fistedly smother everything else in the mix. I feel like I'm listening to a rickety performance from a local band at a sports bar. I mean, I get in a sense the band may be going for something different here, but this is not the groove or fluidity I typically expect from a Chili Pepper song.\r
\r
The last leg on the project is a bit of a mixed bag. There's “The Heavy Wing” that I mentioned earlier. The verse, melodies on “Veronica” oddly enough sound like a bland rip off of the verses from Alanis Morissette's “Head Over Feet”. No idea why that's the case. And we also have the acoustic laid back and chill closer “Tangelo”, which makes for kind of a moody, but fleeting moment on the record.\r
\r
And look, overall I will say this project was a bit of a tough sell for me honestly. Even if there were some highlights on it or moments where the band brought some of the coolest grooves and song ideas they've had in years, but there are just as many tracks or lyrical passages that I'm slightly repulsed by. Not to mention the whole thing overall feels like a bit of a slog, really an overabundance of material for a record that doesn't seem to know what it's set out to do.\r
