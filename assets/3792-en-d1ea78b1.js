const e=`This is a brand new album from the most toxic, the most auto-tuned, the most syrup-drenched rapper from Atlanta, Future. His ninth full-length album and his third project of the 2020s so far, which I think up to this very short point has been kind of a dry spell for Future, because on his «High Off Life» record even he was sounding a little tired of the same sounds and lyrical tropes that he's had in heavy rotation for the past five years. I also reviewed his collab record with Lil Uzi Vert that dropped in 2020 as well and I cannot recall a single song from that album. Now, I'm happy to report though that “I Never Liked You” is coming off a lot bolder and more memorable by comparison, and not because Future is reinventing the wheel here or even experimenting with song structure a bit and somewhat cooler production as he did on «The WIZRD».\r
\r
Genuinely, I think he is sounding somewhat revitalized on some of these tracks, bringing his animated flows and lyrical toxicity to new heights over a crop of pretty decent bangers. Like, with the opener «712PM», where Future says:\r
\r
«Oh, she don't like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay».\r
\r
There's also a point where he doesn't care if like «this guy shoots up a church», because he's «a God walking on this Earth?». That's a bit much. But yeah, through all of these relentless lines, Future is just giving us immense levels of cold bloodedness, underscored by a banging trap beat laced with all of these distant and kind of foreign melodies. There's also «Keep it Burnin» featuring Kanye West. Now, Kanye fans have most likely heard a version, an earlier version of this song through the Donda 2 cycle. I may not be crazy about the final version of this chorus, but still I do find this track to be a highlight mostly because of Kanye and Future's complete verses now, Kanye's performance is completely unhinged — the cracked inflections and Futures flow and the first verse he does are great, the more retrospective tones takes lyrically and the second is nice too. For some reason, his charisma is just firing on all cylinders with this one. The song «Gold Stacks» goes monstrously hard too, but there are some cuts in the tracklist that take a bit of a softer approach as well, they may not have as high impact, they may not be my favorites, but they still do add quite a bit of value to the tracklist. Like the blissfully relaxed «Puffin On Zootiez», or «Love You Better». Yeah, this track may be short and it may have a few goofy vocalizations here and there, but this is actually one of the most genuinely heartbroken and heartfelt songs Future's ever laid to tape. His sweet and passionately vocals, his singing is actually quite nice, the reverbed out keys and gentle beat pair nicely. Really, the only issue I have is that I wish there was more to it, especially toward the end as Future makes mention of his his gentleness having been learned from his grandmother and it kind of seems like in that moment there was more to say or more to extend off of, but it just kind of finishes there.\r
\r
So, there are also a handful of pretty strong moments in the second half of the record as well. Kodak Black on «Voodoo» for example, this may be that dude's best sung feature on any record ever. This track also features one of the more impassioned performances on the record from Future as well, even if his lyrics don't really line up with the tragic tone of what Kodak is saying on his chorus. Then, «Holy Ghost» is one of the most murderous and depraved songs Future has ever put out. The callousness and aggression he showcases in his lyrics here is just next level. Plus, on top of that, the very tense soundtrack strings and chorus sections laced into the beat, like really heighten things to an epic level. There is a dire, but righteous energy to the song «The Way Things Going», which brings another nice emotional change of pace, a legit catchy chorus as well:\r
\r
«The way things goin', made my whole crowd scatter».\r
And then, I'm on one with Drake actually brings back that classic «What a Time to Be Alive» grimy smooth combo energy that they had going on that record. And this cut is way better than that comatose-ass song that they both had earlier on this LP, which is honestly a total snoozefest complete skip. Future does his thing on the front end and Drake actually sounds animated and engaged with a few flow switches in the second half.\r
\r
So yeah, there are some serious highlights on this record, just like there are with any other Future album, but usually in my experience, like the quality gap between the good tracks and the subpar tracks on his stuff, it's pretty wide, but I didn't find that to be as much the case here. A lot of the songs outside of my favorite tracks I thought were okay. You know, Future by the numbers, but nothing like offensive or complete trash. Whether you're talking about «Massaging Me», which I wish was longer, there's also «Chickens» where EST Gee actually delivers one of the better feature verses here. «We Just Wanna Get High» as well, which is fine, but simultaneously is just about as by the numbers as a Future song gets at this point.\r
\r
But still, I do want to get into at least a few tracks that I thought were real duds. Like, for one, the sorry ass closing track on this thing, which starts out as any other sad and average Future song would, but gradually the track progresses into this slow syrup-drenched stumble fizzling out pointlessly at the very finish, just kind of seems like a cop-out of an ending for the record. There's also «I’m Dat N\\*\\*\\*\\*», which in my opinion is way too freaking long, I would say by the two minute and 30 second mark we pretty much get like the point and the vibe of the track, there's no reason for it to go on for like an additional two minutes, especially since Future doesn't have the best hook on the record here and doesn't have a whole lot to say. In fact, I think cutting out early would have prevented this line from seeing the light of day:\r
\r
«Fucked her in the ass, made her peepee (Woo)».\r
\r
Weird flex, but okay. Then, there's also «For a Nut» with Gunna and Young Thug, which is just trying really hard to be gross sexually and misogynistic, to the point where it's not even shocking, it's just a sort of desperate for attention and sad. The song is loaded with all of these weird and kind of gross references, like Gunna at one point who says:\r
\r
«She ripped off his Dior shirt 'cause it had nut stains (Nut stains)».\r
You are a grown man, you cannot keep cum stains off your designer? You don't wash it after? Guys, we have to do better, we can't be walking around with cum stains all over. But yeah, Future on the track is frankly annoying, Young Thugs, a couple of weird bars here:\r
\r
«She just ate cum, we in Hong Kong (Woo)\r
Big shades on just like Farrakhan (Woo)»\r
\r
And there are the songs only real saving grace:\r
\r
«I just put some diamonds in her butt (Butt)».\r
\r
Yeah, I'm not enjoying this track and those are essentially my thoughts on this LP. Yeah, is it one of Future's better projects? I think so, but it's still kind of a mixed bag and see's Future of lazily sauntering through some tracks, also hitting us with some bad and ridiculous and sometimes tasteless ideas on others, but that's something for me I sort of expected at this point and I know is going to be a turn off for me going into projects like this. But if that's not the case for you, that's not going to be a barrier to enjoyment for you on this project for sure.\r
