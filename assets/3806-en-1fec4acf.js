const e=`This is the seventh full-length studio LP of one of a kind Detroit rapper Quelle Chris, one of the most eccentric and thoughtful lyricists the underground has to offer these days, who spent the last decade building up one of the most colorful and odd discographies in left field hip-hop of the 2010s. And while, it's great that over the years Chris has truly matured into a real album artist. It's often some of his most all over the place LPs that do leave a lasting impression on me. Whether that be “Ghost at the Finish Line” or his first “Innocent Country” record, also his one-time crossover with Jean Grae.\r
\r
“Deathfame” by comparison though is a lot more focused and feels like yet another deep dive into Chris's psyche in his catalogue. Much like his album “Being You is Great…”. But this time the textures and attitudes brought to the table on this project are a lot darker, grimier too, and it also feels like there's less to laugh about on this album, as Chris reflects on his fame, his mortality, as well as his talents and the general lack of appreciation for them. Which is funny because, in his entire discography, this LP might be one of his least accessible projects yet. I have no doubt the fans he's built up to this point will be into it, but in a way on this record it feels almost like we're returning back to that vibe of the hip-hop equivalent to Saturday morning cartoons, but you're on so much LSD watching them, your brain is fried, but now we also have a very hefty helping of existential crisis to kind of pull us through all of it. The moody vibes on this record are so thick, you could cut them with a knife, you could just plunge your arm into them like a bowl full of jello and wiggle them around.\r
\r
Whether that be on these slo-mo vapor wavy sac samples on the sort of interlude track “Die Happy Knowing They'll Care”, which is a supremely depressing passage of this record that feels like being pulled even deeper into an abyss of some sort. There is a similar effect being brought to the table by the “Help I'm Dead” interlude in the second half of the LP too. There's also “The Agency of the Future”, which features these chilling drones, very weird distant background vocals doing this old school hip-hop routine about killing hip-hop. Meanwhile, Chris's rap delivery has this very deep gravelly tone to it, as he braggadociously talks up his talent and his dark humor:\r
\r
“On your mind like Nas X news on Boosie timeline”\r
“Dead man walkin', leave him pale-faced like Mark Angel on my left wants no part\r
Devil on my right like, “Hark”.\r
\r
There's a similarly cavernous and droney quality to the closing track on the LP too.\r
\r
There's also “Alive Ain't Always Living”, which was the first taste we got of this record and stands is one of my favorite Quelle Chris tracks so far, with a lot of weary lo-fi piano loops and dusty drums, Chris delivers on this track a very simple and sad mix of singing and rapping that he nailed down pretty good on “Innocent Country 2”, of course Chris' keys is in the mix again on production. But yeah, essentially the song is about just kind of making it day to day, barely getting by mentally and emotionally and just kind of wanting peace of mind. And while the delivery on this track is low key, don't let that distract you from the poignance in Chris's pen here. Because we do get like Andre 3000 levels of passion and perception, especially in the final verse, where he writes about reconnecting with loved ones and spits out bits of wordplay like:\r
\r
“Bottles poppin' off, so many lost, plenty, my memory's shot”\r
\r
And he's just kind of rattling this stuff off, like it's nothing.\r
\r
There's also the track “How Could You Love Something Like Me?”, which is a very odd change of pace. There's something weirdly Lynchian about it, it's pretty much this sad little piano passage, very lullaby style in three four, some jazzy embellishments here and there. And Chris is singing not so much on top of, but underneath these pianos in a lot of ways, very weirdly with what sounds like either some subtle little touches of effects or maybe a chorus or an overdub to make it sound even more obscured than it already is. And some of the lyrics about feeling trapped or unfocused and having to hold in screams so other people don't hear them, certainly do add to the overall energy and ethos and themes of this album.\r
\r
So yeah, there are many dark and emotionally potent passages to this LP for sure. In some ways, I see this album as abstract hip-hop of the highest order, like going so far down that rabbit hole that some of the tracks here don't even really feel traditionally like hip-hop songs. Because it seems like Chris is more focused on creating theater than mere rap songs. Even tracks on this thing that are easier to listen to, like “Feed the Heads” for example still come off like a surrealist interpretation of a hip-hop tune, as the storytelling here comes off like this very animated, kind of dominance fantasy with Chris referencing his talent, his success, interviews, award shows. But then, in the middle of verses, we kind of get this aside jumping and saying “meanwhile” let me sort of jump from scene to scene from idea to idea in the track. With these really amazing, but cartoony call and response refrains on the chorus, with Chris asking “if I don't do it, who can?”. Meaning, if he's not around, who's gonna do as much for hip-hop as he's going to?\r
\r
“King in Black” has a similar vibe to it with these insanely loose bits of drums and bass, some detuned vocal harmonies as well. Lyrically, we get a lot of egoism on this cut. Chris essentially throwing his competition into the trash bin all for the sake of creating this surrealist image of a braggadocio's hip-hop song again, which feels part serious, but then also part satire too.\r
\r
There are also some feature heavy tracks on this LP that kind of range. Navy Blue's lengthy appearance in the second half of “So Tired You Can't Stop Dreaming” does kind of drag the song out to an unnecessary length. To the point where it kind of loses focus with the general themes of the LP. Denmark Vessey and J Jig Cicero offer some of the most hyped features on the entire LP, they're a real tag team lyrically here, it's just that Chris's heavily manipulated vocals in between their appearances kind of just don't really leave that much of an impact on the track, really they're the least interesting thing here. And “The Sky Is Blue Because the Sunset Is Red” does have some very touching piano loops that I like a lot, Chris's very perceptive opening verse certainly makes the song a highlight too, saying:\r
\r
“How the chillest out of all my niggas end up in fast lanes?\r
Greener grass dies on either side when seasons change”.\r
\r
But the lack of variation across the track does make its six minute runtime a bit of a tough pill to swallow, even if Pink Siifu and Moruf are there to break things up a little bit.\r
\r
There's a kind of inconclusive ending to the LP as well, but the title track, which would have made for a more interesting closer, does hit pretty hard, it does explain the general concept and theme of this record overall pretty nicely, and it also reminds me of an older Quelle Chris track too. Actually, one of the first tracks I ever heard from the guy, the song “Loop Dreams”, which in a much earlier part of Chris's career was a song all about kind of growing into this role of being a rapper, being a creator, seeing some kind of success off of his efforts doing this. And this title song is dealing in a lot of the same themes is born out of many of those same aspirations, but Chris's attitude this time around is in this journey to get fame — “fuck it, I'm gonna die trying or I could die trying, and as a result of that I will end up getting the attention that I have been deserving of and have been desiring this whole time”. Yes, dying will be the quickest way to get that validation and that attention that I seek, you can keep your flowers, I can't eat your flowers. There's also a point where he depicts his legacy of being bitten on the neck parasitically, like a vampire by the music industry, corporations. And yeah, it's grim, but that's also the general energy and vibe of this LP put very bluntly.\r
\r
Now with that being said, there are some tracks here that pale in comparison to others, drag on a bit too long, don't focus on the overall theme of the record all that well. The closing track fails to really tie things up all that effectively. There are some issues, this is far from a perfect Quelle Chris record and he has definitely put out better in the past, especially when it comes to focusing on the key concept track to track. But still, “Deathfame” is a good record from Chris and it does have some incredible high points on it for sure and there's certainly no album he's made so far that gets quite this dark and this unforgiving. That alone makes this project stand out out of all the very quality records he's put out so far.\r
