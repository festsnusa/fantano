const e=`The Swedish electro pop duo The Knife take on some collaborators — I've already mentioned Planningtorock, I've already mentioned Mount Sims, but to throw more names on top of the pile this thing was commisioned as a soundtrack/opera for the Danish performance art group Hotel Pro Forma. And the subject matter — Charles Darwin, his work and the big theory of evolution, which isn't that unusual considering that this very same performance art group also put on a production about Leon Theremin, the inventor of the most untouchable musical instrument — the theremin.\r

So, that's the concept, which is pretty unusual, pretty experimental, so that must mean this thing is really great. So in all honesty, this thing is a complete and utter mess printed to two discs, and it just throws abstract after abstract at you without actually pulling any of them together, which you would think would happen considering that this thing is so heavily based upon “a concept”. And I feel like everyone's enamored with the concept more than there are the actual music itself. I can just imagine people in my head listening to this, hearing the noise and the dissonant and just thinking that this is something revolutionary. In order to look at this LP as music, as musical piece, we have to separate it from its concept, because its concept has little to nothing to do with the sound and the texture of this LP.\r

The whole thing starts with these really glitchy electronic blips that build into this multi-layered drone, and this is where the operatic vocals first show. Now, it feels like it's building towards something, and this really had me excited about the LP, I thought I was really going to be in for something very conceptual, very avant-garde, very perceptive. All this noise, all this feedback and distortion starts feedinng itself into the mix, and then once it gets into the third track, the whole LP just gets increasingly more and more difficult without rhyme or reason. The chords and the melodies get more dissonant and the sounds get harsher and these field recordings start introducing themselves, but it never really clicks to me as “a genius”. All I can say is it doesn't really stimulate me like a John Cage prepared piano piece, it doesn't put a chill up my spine like any given track off of Laurie Anderson's “Big Science”, and it doesn't horrify me like many of the dark ambient pieces on any Lustmord album. A lot of the noises just callously repeat themselves over and over. So, because this thing is about evolution, we're just going to give the green light to be boring. Karin Anderson as Fever Ray put together a pretty dark LP last year, and I know her brother makes a pretty experimental strange stuff by himself. But still, I think their solo stuff is kind of a huge jump from what this LP is trying to do. And The Knife wildly acknowledges that they have no prior experience scoring or even frequenting operas, and I think this album is an example of the trainwreck that can happen when you approach avant-garde composition like a blind date.\r

Now, the second LP is very musical, and I guess you could say it's where this thing really pays off — it opens up with “Annie's Box” which is very beautiful, very tonal, very somber, and it even opens up later into the track “Colouring of Pigeons” which is a fantastic piece of this LP. Now even though “Colouring of Pigeons” is a really awesome track, after that song the entire LP proceeds to go batshit insane and turn itself into a joke, throwing these four to the floor beats into the song “Seeds” with sounds like it's made up of all these Fruity Loops pre-set loops and sounds. And sort of to add insult to injury, they throw a track at the end of the album called “The Height of Summer” which sounds dangerously close to “Heartbeats”. Yes, the song “Heartbeats” that we know and love. It's like an effigy of the track, and it's a big F-— you to anyone who's expecting this LP to be anything interesting, fun, accesible or cohesive.\r
\r
Now, to be honest, The Knife was commisioned to do this piece by Hotel Pro Forma so we can only speculate how much artistic freedom they had over this LP because they could just be making music to sort of fit to the very avant-garde experimental nature of this performance group. Plus, this thing is a performance piece — there's some footage on YouTube, and when you sit down and watch the whole thing there could be so much more context given to this soundtrack. I just can't help but feel like for the entire duration of this album there really should be some visual to go with this audio. I know a decent amount of people are going to and already have followed The Knife in this direction just because they're The Knife, and all music aside this is a cool concept and it is kind of an unusual direction for them to take their music in. But I unfortunately can't follow them in this direction.\r
