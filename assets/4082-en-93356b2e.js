const e=`A new full-length album from The Lemon Twigs, a band I've been aware of for a minute, but never did a full deep formal review on any of their projects up until now. I would typically enjoy a single of theirs here and there, get a kick out of the nostalgic camp they bring to the table and then move on. But I was consistently impressed so much with every single in the lead up to this new album, I had to dig in further and hear more. So I looked into them and was interested to find that the guys whose spearhead the band Brian and Michael are Italian brothers, whose father was also a recording artist Ronnie D'Addario, a mainstream one. So don't go all crazy with the weird nepotism comments. And they've been recording music together for years even as children. They have this banger from over a decade ago called "Trophy Girl", which is quite a trip. So it's like the D'Addario boys were born into this in a way. And as The Lemon Twigs they've been doing it for four full-length formal albums now. Once again, they are pulling from the past. But this time around they're not focusing quite as much on the 60s pop, psych rock and glam they've been known for as of late. "Everything Harmony" is more of a soft rock affair, and I'm not talking about the cool strains of the genre that the current day music intelligentsia has deemed worthy of listening to, like Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan. No, I'm talking about the dramatic and overly sentimental types of soft rock that most people these days would rather ignore. We're getting little The Eagles, we're getting a little Carpenters, we're getting a little mid-era Chicago. This record is a total time machine musically and not usually the thing I go for, especially when the influences are so obvious. But damn, if the songs aren't amazing and crafted so well, masterfully well.\r

Be it on tracks that ride the corny highs of love sickness or surprisingly meta and topical tracks that are so showy and on the nose in a funny way. Be that the title track where Brian and Mike lyrically are listing out all these things that they like: hair when it's flowy, not laughing when something isn't funny, everything being in harmony, stuff that goes together. There's almost an OCD level focus on stuff just making sense on this cut. Which also manifests in the tumbling and angular repetitive melodies throughout the track that are odd, but catchy. And of course, over these melodies you have the vocals singing in very close harmony. "Every Day Is the Worst Day of My Life" is a big acoustic cut with skilled and dramatic guitar work and topped over for that is literally the phrase "every day is the worst day of my life" over and over with different vocal passages. But it's never lyrically explained as to why things are so awful. The vocal performance is so passionate on the cut, you believe the lyrics without further explanation.\r

There are a few rockers that are pretty fun as well. "Ghost Run Free" features fun and jangly guitars flirting with touches of hard rock and psych. There's a bright synth-backed chorus on the track too that feels so sunny and carefree. Whole thing sounds like the theme song to a 70s sitcom where a three sorority sisters are raising a ghost child, as they're trying to make it in the big city. "In My Head" is a groovy little pop rock cut with some of the catchiest melodies I've heard this year, such nimble lines throughout this track. "What You Were Doing" put some John Lennon-esque vocals and Beatles harmonies over some riffs to have proto-punk and old school power pop feel to them. Not my favorite tune, but an unlikely stylistic combo that goes down pretty easy.\r

But it's truly the ballads that are this album's bread and butter, especially in the first leg. "When Winter Comes Around" is a great introductory cut with wonderful and beautiful finger pick guitar, it's very bulky, it's topped with the spot lit and tender lead vocals and endearing lyrics about the seasons changing, a leaf that returns in the fall that no one can recall when winter comes around. The powerful rush of instrumentation around the midpoint of the cut is heavenly, it's overwhelming too. It's the first track of the record. Brian, Michael, why are you doing this? I can't cry this early on the album. Already off the bat, this record is scratching all the right theatrical itches. And that is done so again with the song "Born to be Lonely". "Corner of My Eye" is another fantastic highlight where we hear more young boyish beautiful vocals over some very refined acoustics. Vibraphone sounds like vibraphone on the chorus as well. It's such a romantic vibe to the song, super cute lyrics:\r
\r
"I saw you twice before\r
Now I really wanna see you more".\r

It's so heartwarming, it stings. "Any Time of Day" is a piano rock powerhouse, those pillowy harmonies, the intense key change toward the end, the boys are nailing it. There's also the powerful centerpiece of "What Happens to a Heart", and this is like "Sometimes When We Touch" by Dan Hill level moment of melodrama, with lyrics like:\r
\r
"Now I know what happens to a heart\r
When all it ever does is hurt\r
It wants a chance to step out of the dark\r
But ends up buried in the dirt".\r
\r
There are also a few somber cuts that pale in comparison to others. They're not terrible by any means and they certainly add to the variety of the record overall, but I'm not exactly burning to return to them when the record is off. Be that "Still It’s Not Enough" or "I Don’t Belong to Me". But there is a pretty strong closer on the album though, which reads like a surreal fantasy where you forget who you are and what the love is that you were engrossed in at one time and then you're reminded by this person, at least that's how I'm reading it. There's something eerily beautiful about the instrumentation and the storytelling on the track for sure. And works as a final moment on this project, because it does deal a lot in memories, and much of what's going on here, in terms of the vibe and aesthetics of this record, is very much based in memory in the past.\r
