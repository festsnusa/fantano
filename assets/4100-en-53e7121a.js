const e=`Detroit rock outfit Protomartyr are back with their sixth full-length LP. And once again, they are staying true to their very despondent brand of sad punk, with maybe some minor alterations around the edges. Their last record "Ultimate Success Today" saw the band building on the simple post-punk formula of their early records to create something more ambitious, dramatic and even gothic. But for sure, some of the impact and memorability was lost along the way. And "Formal Growth in the Desert" feels like another attempt at nailing that balance between grim and artsy, but also captivating and catchy. Though, I was worried going into this record we would be in for another slight disappointment, given that the lead single "Make Way" was a tough sell. We have a lot of very low, bellowing, Nick Cave-esque spoken word passages, alternating with these thunderous guitars and shouty refrains. And while, it's a strong contrast, it's also disjointed in the most awkward of ways. Plus, the progression of the song undergoes from here is a bit of a slog too. Though, it's definitely brooding, this thing broods. There's quite a few tracks on this thing I could say the same thing about. But rarely do they build up the tension they create into anything interesting. Feeling limited in their capacity to inspire fear or unease.\r

Plus, I usually find frontman Joe Casey to be way more gripping than the instrumentals and chord progressions that support him. Be it on "Fun in Hi Skool", which comes to a pretty unfulfilling finish. The story on "Fulfillment Center" is literally one of inconclusion too, a tale of tragedy following a fruitless search. Then, the busy looping, rhythm section and thin tinny guitars on "Let's Tip the Creator" get mind-numbing after a while, growing more and more stale as it plods along. I feel somewhat similarly about "The Author", as well as "Graft vs. Host", where the rhythms and basic guitars aren't that much of a complement to the drama brought by the tunes in Joe's vocals.\r

Out of all the slowburners on this record, the best has to be "Elimination Dances". The instrumental there is actually quite murderous. And then, there's also a closer "Rain Garden", where we get some crushing walls of bass guitar and also strings that add a lot of drama into the mix. It all culminates into very powerful, enveloping sound, it is a very urgent and dark vibe that I wish was more prevalent on the rest of the record, as it's definitely more inspired and tortured than most of what's here. There's also a great beat switch on the track in the second half, a very eerie and romantic ending.\r

Now, generally I get more out of the punchier moments on this record. Like "For Tomorrow", with its driving guitars and pounding drums, this track definitely pulls more from the punkier end of the spectrum. Plus, with the occasional synth arpeggio, the track has a subtle new wave flare to it too. There are some equally explosive moments deeper into the tracklist as well. Like the very tense "Polacrilex Kid", which has odd, persistent groove to it, Joe syncs up with the beat on this track tightly, with these shouty, staccato vocal lines, it's like he's in an argument with the instrumental. The pronounced verses on this track alternate with these bright shimmering walls of guitar that are actually pretty for a Protomartyr record. Then, there's "3800 Tigers", which is the most explosive cut on the entire album. It's like a funky noise rock track with a 60s acid rock jam quality to it. Again, goth twist too. And honestly, I haven't heard this band sounding this fiery since some of their early stuff.\r
\r
But yeah, overall this album I thought it was a mixed bag. There are some bops, there are a lot of slowburners, many of which grow a bit stagnant. But the few that do work very well. Vut even with the critiques, I still think these guys are one of the better goth adjacent bands in the underground today.\r
