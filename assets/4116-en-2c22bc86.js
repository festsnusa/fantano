const e=`Sophomore record from New York band Geese. Got introduced to these guys through some of the teasers to this album, I enjoyed them, so I looked forward to the record, and that's pretty much it. I also caught them once on a very odd live bill that also included Alice Longyu Gao, and they gave a great performance. But since then, I've basically just been waiting and waiting to hear "3D Country". And now, it's here, let's go.\r
\r
This record is as fire as I hoped it would be. The songs, performances and band chemistry on this thing are all great. And in addition to that, I feel like this record also stands as a shining example of how to do revivalism right. Because, now that I'm able to hear the entire project, it's pretty clear that one of Geese's biggest influences on this thing are the golden days of hard rock and 60s blues rock. The opener "2122" has all these twisted, fiery guitar riffs throughout it, it's very Zeppelin, it's very Hendrix. But the wildly overstated vocals and certain noisy experimental pockets of the track leave it feeling very new and modern, and art punk.\r
\r
However, there's something about the band and the way they play that makes this record a little hard to place too. Because this could have just as easily dropped during the heydays of many proto-punk greats, such as Richard Hell, or Television, New York Dolls, MX-80 Sound, even The Modern Lovers.\r
\r
The opener is fiery, hard-hitting, great. But even when the band tones things down, like on the title track, their odd charms still pour through. This cut is a groovy and low down fusion of classic rock and soul, with some prominent pianos and show-stopping background singers. Frontman Cameron Winter is especially slaying it on the vocal side of things, because the way he's just so over the top consistently on these tracks, makes them hit even harder, he sounds like an emotionally unstable Warren Zevon. He gets especially animated and freaky on the closing track "St. Elmo". And kudos on his lyricism as well, because sometimes it reads very interestingly, like an absurd or surreal reinterpretation of the genres of rock music that he's pulling from. With lyrics like:\r
\r
"Hit me baby, show me the floor",\r
\r
as well as:\r
\r
"What I saw could make a dead man die".\r
\r
The song "Cowboy Nudes" sounds like what you would get if you had The Strokes and Rolling Stones collab at their respective creative peaks. Plus, also one of the most insanely hyped rhythmic breakdowns I've heard on any song in 2023.\r
\r
I wouldn't say this record is all goofiness though, because you do have cuts like "I See Myself", one of the most genuinely sweet and passionate love songs I've heard this year. The group chorus is incredible, the sensual grooves throughout the verses stick with me, and those falsetto highs that Cameron's hitting at a few points on the song are crazy, his range is insane. The song "Undoer" switches things up, it's an attempt from the band at hitting us with a very long, winding, tense jam. Not my favorite song on the record, but the performance is great and it's awesome to hear a modern rock recording that feels very live, very lightning in a bottle, very in-the-moment. Conversely, the song "Crusades" is a lot more straightforward and to the point, maybe to a fault, as the plainly strummed, mid-paced guitar chords don't inspire too much. Plus, the song attached to it isn't a stunner either, even if I do like some of the tangy strings thrown into the mix.\r
\r
But still, despite this little lull at the midpoint, record finishes as strong as it starts. There's "Gravity Blues", which is quite glammy in comparison with all the other cuts, with the pianos coming in hot, powerful vocal harmonies, guitar solos layered up as well. The band can arrange a rock experience when they want to. Be that on the psychedelic finish of this track or the weird, noise, chaotic freak out around the 1:20 mark.\r
\r
Geese certainly showcases a lot of dynamics on this record, which is also the case for "Mysterious Love", which features these thunderous riff passages, some of the heaviest and most explosive on the record. But this contrasts with a very lush and hypnotic ending, with more beautiful vocal harmonies and guitars layering up. Not only that, but a hypnotic refrain, that's unsettling when I read it and hear it over and over:\r
\r
"Some people are alone forever, some people are alone forever".\r
\r
From here, we have the very regal and subtle "Domoto" and the multi-phased and string kissed "Tomorrow's Crusades". And it's cool to hear the band tie things up in a very versatile way toward the end of this record, not even coming close to painting themselves into a corner, while also not pushing outside of their comfort zone too.\r
\r
But yeah, this Geese record, I'm impressed, it's a nice, solid, well-written, well-performed rock album, from a band with a lot of potential, a lot of personality and a healthy base of influences that they very clearly pull from without making it feel like it's just an exercise in nostalgia, or a copy of a copy.\r
