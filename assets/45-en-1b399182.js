const e=`Flying Lotus is a music producer from California whose knack for music sampling and sound production, sound manipulation basically smashes any preconceived notions of what hip-hop is or what hip-hop influenced music is. I mean, we all know Girl Talk, and Girl Talk makes these mishmashes of radio pop tunes. If Flying Lotus mishmashes stuff, it's like a tapestry of the strange, the eerie, misfit samples that other DJs just won't touch or just don't know where they are, can't find them, have no clue they exists. Flying Lotus' 2008 LP "Los Angeles" caused a fiercely positive wave of reviews just hit him. And I have a feeling this new LP is going to do the same, with maybe even more positive reviews, simply because he's opening himself up to a wider listening audience.\r

On "Cosmogramma" you're not going to find a traditional song, that's not what this thing is about. You're gonna pretty much find ideas, concepts, motifs, some feel fleshed out and some really don't. But "Cosmogramma" doesn't just throw different songs at you, it's constantly throwing different sounds at you. This thing just has a galaxy's worth of instrumentation: a ton of harp, which isn't surprising because Alice Coltrane is actually Flying Lotus' great aunt, also, you have special guests, Rebekah Raff playing a lot of harp on this LP; strings, horns, scat vocals, break beats. Those aren't only the instruments that you can actually identify. But I've written down a few things that I actually think are on this album, but I cannot confirm: screaming, dentist drill, space laser, water, ping-pong balls, train, bass solo.\r

There are quite a few significant guest stars on this album too. You could say this bro named Thom Yorke from this band named Radiohead is on the 7th track "...and the World Laughs With You". You also have Laura Darlington who's in the electronic music duo The Long Lost who also was on a Flying Lotus' last LP too. And of course, Flying Lotus' cousin Ravi Coltrane Coltrane plays some saxophone on here too. Which just speaks to how strong the jazz element is on this album. Though, jazz is most definitely not the only thing that is represented throughout "Cosmogramma", it's way more prevalent than it was on "Los Angeles" between all the jazz sampling, all the jazz soloing, just how borderless some of the music feels. And the track titled "Arkestry" has to be some kind of Sun Ra reference. But I guess if you could boil this album down to one thing, it would be a variety, in terms of style, in terms of sound, there's just a lot that hits you between the beginning and the end of this record.\r

But whether or not this LP is good, that depends on what you want and what you're looking for. If you're looking for a series, a very consistent, very well developed sounds, you may not find that here. Instead of making sure one nail is square into the whole, Flying Lotus is just a little all over the map with this LP. And if you're not into the art of sampling or music collage, I can see a lot of these tracks flying by as if they're just filler. But that's just sort of the exploratory nature of this LP — instead of giving you one thing, and maybe that one thing is done incredibly well, it gives you a little bit of dubstep, it gives you a little bit of hip-hop, a little bit of club music, a little bit of techno sounds, a little bit of jazz, a little bit of cuts from a hundred other different things. But in comparison to "Los Angeles", "Cosmogramma" is a lot cleaner, a lot less vinyl crackle, it's more colorful, it's more accessible, less primal, less cohesive, a little more upbeat.\r

I'm torn between "LA" and "Cosmogramma", you don't necessarily need to pick one or the other, you can like both. And I do like both for different reasons. "Cosmogramma" is a diverse musical trip, but I don't think it even comes close to touching how bleak and moody "LA" is. I basically see the difference between these two albums, as let's say you're a huge fan of Japanese food and you want the most hard-core, authentic Japanese best of the best food, it is just pure concentrated best Japanese food you ever had, that's "LA". I see "Cosmogramma" as more of a buffet — sure, there's Japanese food at the buffet and it's not the best of the best, but when you go to the buffet you can get the Japanese food on your plate, you can get the falafel, tofu and you can also get a hamburger all on one plate. There's no other place you're going to get all that on your plate. Though, it's not the cream of the crop, though it's not the most finely tuned of all these different types of foods, it's pretty much the only place you're going to get all this diversity.\r
\r
But I don't want to rain on anybody's parade, because of all the press leading up to this LP, because of Flying Lotus affiliation with the Gonjasufi album, because Thom Yorke is on this LP, there are going to be a lot of first time listeners when it comes to Flying Lotus. And they're probably going to love this thing. This thing has a ton of different sounds on it, it's going to hold the tension, even for people who have short attention spans.\r
