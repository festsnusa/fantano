const e=`This is a debut full-length LP of Swedish quartet Holograms. And this is now now on "Captured Tracks" records, a surprising release for the label. Surprising for me, because the bands on "Capture Tracks" have a reputation for having very lo-fi recording styles and production that has slathered in reverb. And I guess once I put it that way, it's not that weird these guys do have some reverb on their recording and their presentation is rough around the edges. But I guess the left hook comes in with this bands very classic post-punk style. They most definitely have an attitude that is not too much unlike that of Gang of Four. And they've also got a very driving and, I want to say, dark momentum, a lot like Joy Division. There's a little bit of garage punk peppered throughout a couple songs on this LP. And there are moments where Holograms feels as frantic and manic as like an early Buzzcocks' song.\r

Even though this band is clearly influenced by the old, they don't sound dated, not by a long shot. To me, they actually sound like a handful of new punk bands that have a very ruffin and grainy quality to their recordings, like the band Ice Age. And I would compare them to the Australian band Royal Headache too. Though, their highs are both low, I would say Holograms emotions or feelings are even lower. Meaning, there is a lot of unhappiness and malcontent between the 12 songs on this LP. I mean, to me the songs on here sound like a cathartic release for this very difficult to fight off depression. But these guys try their asses off to fight off depression with very crunchy, head bashing guitars, hard-hitting tight drums and the occasional keyboard too.\r

Pretty much every single song on this LP takes a very simple approach an almost Wire's "Pink Flag" level of simplicity. The track "Chasing my Mind" comes to mind with very basic synth melody that plays over and over throughout the song, and a chord progression that by now you have probably heard in about a hundred thousand songs. There are not a lot of details hidden between the choruses and the verses on this thing. And they are not really between the layers of instrumentation either and the very rough production muffles what salties there are. But salty even when Holograms is playing a slower or a sadder song. It's not really their game. Instead, these guys are trying to perform these tracks with straight guts and spunk, with some very memorable hooks that are emphasized by eccentric vocals. And that depression, I was talking about earlier, it leads to a lot of tortured songs.\r

The opening track "Monolith" is a little unsettling, describing a scene with people standing in line, in concrete floors, the factory setting that I've heard or read these guys work in as the day job. And other tracks on here, like "Stress" and "Memories of Sweat", and especially "ABC City" repeat a lot of the same grievances bringing this theme of the album. Especially "ABC City", talking about isolation and desolation in the lyrics. It's a theme that ties this entire album together. And these guys deal with the tension in different ways. Other songs on here come off more frenetic. Like the track "Transform", which has wailing guitars screaming in the background, with syncopated bass and drum hits laying on this wild groove. But there's a sliver of bright attitude on the track "Astray", which has octave pumping synthesizers and handclaps toward the end of the song. And the track "Fever" gets pretty anthemic with a little synth line toward the finished that track too.\r
\r
If I had any gripes about it, it's that execution-wise I do feel like this album could have a little bit more to it. Five-minute tracks like "You Are Ancient (Sweden's Pride)" I could have been delivered with a bit more intensity to make this song not only feel climactic, but worth the five minutes it lasts. Most of the songs on here fit in a 2-3 minute range and it's really a perfect song length for these guys. It's fantastic how these guys do a lot with a little. Stylistically, I do wish this band was a little more unique, a touch more unique, but I feel like these guys do make up for the lack of innovation with some really catchy and great songs. Basic, but strong and infectious. I love the moody dark attitude of this thing, I love this style, I love how the 12 songs on this thing lyrically attack the root of that sadness that is really getting to these guys. I feel like Holograms has a lot of going for them.\r

FAV TRACKS: MONOLITH, ORPHEO, MEMORIES OF SWEAT, ABC CITY, STRESS, ASTRAY\r
\r
LEAST FAV TRACK: I'm gonna say CHASING MY MIND, but it's not like I disliked it or anything. A decent track, but I feel the others on here are more impressive.\r
