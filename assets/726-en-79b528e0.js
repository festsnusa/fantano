const e=`These guys are a Pennsylvanian band, this is their sophomore studio LP and since their earliest releases they've been incorporating elements of punk rock, pop punk, post hardcore into their music with a bit of an emo twist. They're a band that really just kind of celebrates all of these underground flavors of rock music that were big in the 90s for the mecca's of creativity that they were. If you give this LP listen, you're definitely going to be picking up hints of Jawbreaker, of Hum, of Knapsack, of Hot Water Music. Maybe you could even liken some of the rips to Nirvana, some of the really strong melodic guitar playing to Dinosaur Jr., and some of the shots of noisy feedback filled distortion to Sonic Youth. The thing is to me this album is just pretty much like a Frankenstein monster of all of the records that kind of drove title fight to make this record. And the thing is whose music isn't that to an extent? Sure, I can see that. What kind of bugs me with Title Fight though is that I can really kind of see the seams of what they've sewn together. The ideas and the influences on this album aren't really melted together with a bit of Title Fight's own signature personality kind of thrown into to make it their own thing. And the only reason I really feel that way is because when it came time to really kind of write this review after listening to this album again and again, I was writing and thinking well their music is influenced by A, B, C and D, but… and then I just continuously drew blank after blank after blank. I just couldn't really say anything after that. Do these guys do anything new or novel with their influences, do they use modern hindsight to kind of think about these records that came out years ago that influenced them in retrospect to kind of develop upon them, maybe do something better, do something a bit more fresh? And I can't really say that happens here, for the most part Title Fight is reliving an era of rock music that was very emotional, very passionate, part melodic, part aggressive that that thrived into the early to mid-2000s.\r

If anything has kind of kept me enjoying this record despite that, the band definitely has a very punchy, modern, loud recording. I mean, really good production on this thing. And maybe the band's two respective songwriters are a bit more aggressive with their vocals, a little bit more unrelenting, just like consistent with that. Despite the extreme lack of originality, if you are into music like this that you will be noticing, what I did end up liking about this band a lot is just their energy, their passion. In fact they're playing these tracks really well and they're writing some really good songs too. And they brought quite a bit of variety to this LP with some pretty hyped tracks, with some slower tracks too. One of the lead singles to this LP “Secret Society” is just a really rowdy single, I love it, it just makes me want to jump into a circle pit of joy. Very catchy vocals on the hook and some subtle vocal harmony that goes on under that “I’ll be you and you’ll be me”. But the chords are just the bomb on this track, the way the guitars are being played is just so blood pumping.\r

Right after that track, the song “Head in the Ceiling Fan” is much slower, much more emotive and really one of my favorite tracks on the LP. It's the first spot on the album where things just really slowed down and when I say slow down I mean like they are going like half speed, like quarter speed in comparison with the other tracks, and it sounds great. At this point on the album, I would actually say Title Fight sounds kind of blissful and here it becomes very obvious that not only is the band able to just write some really fast, aggressive, captivating moments with that kind of flavor, but they can be captivating going slow and then very kind of heavy sonically and emotionally too. I like that versatility. And then, there's the track “Make You Cry” that comes in after that, where I feel like both of those worlds kind of come together with a nice rich melody that comes in on the hook.\r

However, for me the LP kind of hits a stride after that, not a good stride. The tracks “Sympathy” to “Calloused” for me really just kind of breeze by, because of the lack of a fresh idea, of a distinct idea, or a distinct take on these sounds. These tracks really just kind of sound very nondescript to me. There are moments toward the beginning of this album that feels same. Though, I like that some faster and more aggressive tracks are coming in here and that the band follows those up with two great closing tracks, which are slower, are a little more toned down and to me are more interesting. Nothing really hit me on the album is being terrible. But like I said, it all kind of comes back to what I mentioned earlier, that nothing on here really hits me as being “oh, this is Title Fight, this is what they do, this is their thing, this is what they have conceived”. That didn't stop me from liking this album a lot, but I do think because some of the tracks did come off forgettable because of that, it did keep me from loving it.\r
