const e=`Laurie Anderson is... I don't know, I can't describe Laurie Anderson all that easily. But what I do know is that she holds a special place in my musical heart. And yes, I could say she's experimental, I could say she's avant-gard, but those aren't all that descriptive. But let me make a futile attempt toward describing what she doesn't. Say, her music is where minimalism, electronics, spoken word and art pop all collide, tied together with lots of vocal manipulation and violent. My first exposure to Laurie Anderson was "Big Science" after having heard the album at the college radio station that I used to be the general manager of. It was an eye-opening experience. Tracks like "From the Air", "Big Science" and "O Superman" had me hooked from the start. I loved the overly abstract narratives and the cold electronics had me feeling Kraftwerk. Of course, I want to make a mention that "Big Science" came out in 1982. And this is Laurie Anderson's first album in 10 years, and this is pretty much about as cinematic as any album is going to get this year. It's not a release that you listen to simply for its music. Though, it is musical. There's more to it than that. The poetry of Laurie's words and sometimes the lack of sound in a given track can mean everything. To me, that's classic Laurie Anderson, because from "Big Science" to "Bright Red" to here, there's always been this prevalent desolation to the sound set of her music, at least some of her music.\r

But going back to the words, the poetry, the verbage, I can't help, but hang on this woman's every word. And on "Homeland", she points out America's faults politically and philosophically, without subjecting listeners to an overly preachy solution to the problem. Instead, she keeps things simple and yet so complicated. Because to tell you the truth, I have no clue what this woman is trying to say, at least half the time. Not that it's gibberish, but a single one of her sentences could be interpreted in about a dozen different ways. Usually I find myself trying to find the most appropriate way to react to one of Laurie Anderson's songs on this album. For example, my favorite track is the 11 minute "Another Day in America". And it's very long, drawn-out narrative. And she tells a story in it, a short story in it, because there are a lot of different passages to this narrative. And this story is about a couple who gets a divorce and they hate each other, and they wait until their 90s to get divorced. And when asked "why did you wait so long to get the divorce?", the response is "well, we wanted to wait until the children died". M initial reaction to that story itself is to laugh, because that's a funny story, that's a joke. However, there's a load of social critique in that, because some people do live like that, that is an extreme, but a lot of people say "we stayed married because we wanted to wait until the kids moved out of the house". And then, you have this third level where you have this story which is funny and has critique in it, but it's set to this very eerie music and this woman with a digitally manipulated voice, which is sort of a bunch of registers lower, is reading off this story in a very strange way. There's a level of creepiness there too. And not that just track, but this entire album is pulling from different emotional sides of me. As Laurie Anderson's work usually does, I'm smiling, I'm inquiring, I'm confused, I'm upset.\r

As far as highlights on this LP, the opening "Transitory Life" is a very hair-raising beginning. The ending of "Flow", which is very pretty violin piece, ends this album very strong too. The story on "The Beginning of Memory" is unbelievably surreal. And the single "Only an Expert" is my least favorite track on this album, though even that track isn't that bad: on this song Laurie dispenses some of the best critiques, some of the best poetry she has on the entire album. But what has me on the fence with this song is that it's set to this techno beat that feels so out of place for me, something that isn't appropriate and maybe a little annoying, bordering on annoying. But Laurie experiments, Laurie adventures, I wouldn't have it any other way. And if she's gonna do a techno beat, she's gonna do a techno beat, that's pretty much it.\r

I see most of this album as Laurie Anderson doing what Laurie Anderson does, but in a much more contemporary fashion. And of course, on this album she also collaborates with Four Tet's Antony. Antony does some vocals on there, John Zorn lays down some psychotic sax. And Lou Reed comes on to play guitar.\r

Let me say that this thing is not for the faint of heart, for people who are impatient, for people have more straightforward sensibilities. If you want to go on an adventure, if you want to try something weird, if you want to try something that is going to hit you a lot of different ways emotionally, something that you will not know how to react to properly, try this album.\r
