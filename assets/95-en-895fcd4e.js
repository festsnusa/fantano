const e=`The band is Superhumanoids and this is "Urgency". These guys are an LA outfit that I've been following for a while now, and this thing is literally their first EP, even though before this there have been some demos, single, and I wrote about these guys back on the old blog when I used to have that. But I was surprised to see that I actually landed a quote from the old blog on to their press release: "their chilly kraut-rock heavy tracks are eerier than an open-casket funeral". Kraut-rock is a pretty clear influence on this EP if you're familiar or a fan of the exploits of bands like Neu! and Can. But I wouldn't call Superhumanoids a kraut-rock band, they're playing within the world of straightforward rock, but there are lots of interesting influences and flavors just hanging in the air on this album, sort of like an aftertaste.\r

This EP has a live in the moment sound, it's just living and it's breathing. There are lots of swells, lots of things that just sound like they're happening right then and there. But there are lots of electronics on this EP too â€” some drum programming and lots of retro synths. It might appeal to the new wave crowd, it's got sweet melodies and hooks, great vocal deliveries, lots of decent musicianship. But there's something off-putting about the music on this EP. It's so simple and broken down to the bare basics that it can't help, but stand out a lot like the very early rock minimalism of Wire. It's almost as if the band is afraid to make too much sound. And to be completely honest, I liked it, it sounds very white and clean, and sanitary, like a laboratory, very mechanical and well-oiled and calculating. And yet, so emotional, so human, it's like an android, a musical android.\r

My one gripe is that it gets underwhelming in a few spots, but only a few. I'm loving most of these tracks. If you're searching for something that's like Okkervil River covering a kraut-rock band, and I only say that because I feel the lead vocals are a lot like the lead vocals on this EP. And how could I forget, there are lots of female vocals on here too. So if you're looking for some female crooning over throbbing electronics, steady, mid-tempo beats, lush keyboards, shimmering guitars, gentle swells and strong songwriting, this is where you want to be. It's simple, minimal and linear rock that you can just get lost in.\r
