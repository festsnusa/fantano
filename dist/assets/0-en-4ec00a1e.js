const t=`This LP was J Dilla's last LP to be released while he was still alive. Unfortunately he passed away just three days later. And because it was pieced together over a long duration of his career, this thing is the result of a lot of different phases in his musical trajectory. Because of that, this thing is just a beautiful, jaw-dropping, smattering of hip-hop instrumentals. No track on this album goes over two minutes and I feel like that is so intentional. There's this one track “Don't Cry”, I believe that just is short of two minutes by one second, just by one second and that other second could have been in there. But no, every track on this thing is so immediate, straightforward, to the point and punctual and that's because nothing on here is really a song per se. Everything really is like a motif, it's a taste, it's a whiff, it's just like a Donut, it's like a box of chocolates, a box of donuts. You're just trying different things, trying different flavors, there's a jelly, there's a glazed, there's a chocolate, you're just getting a little bit of everything. All these little splashes of color, all these little dabs of musical gold. Critique this thing how you may, say what you want negative about it, just do not call it boring. It can't possibly be that, because nothing really sticks around on this album long enough for boredom to really set in to be quite honest.\r

I feel like a lot of the beats on this LP are like motifs, like little toys, little widgets, stickery do's whatever you want to call them, you just take them out you look at them you're like oh that's cute that's pretty little knickknacks here throughout this LP. Yeah, just looking at it, that's cool, put it back, grab another one, put it back, but when you're listening to all these tracks from beginning to end, a lot of them fade into each other, many of them jump into one another, only a few of them kind of just end and then the next one just starts. But all together it feels like this really cohesive neo-soul left field hip-hop journey, this musical odyssey through the world of underground hip-hop instrumentals. We've got a lot of flavors on this LP, ranging from the really weird track, very strange track called “The Factory”, also we have this really smoky, smooth one that I made that i made a note of “Walkinonit” and also this really funky track “Airworks” too, just a lot of different musical emotions throughout this LP. J Dilla really does not work himself into any stylistic corners. Except for maybe the fact that he samples a lot of soul, that's sort of come to be expected of him, but he just creates so many moods, so many emotions, just limiting himself to a lot of the same musical sources.\r
\r
And even though I think, most of these tracks most of them honestly, don't really work outside of the context of the entire album — you take them out, they're fine, they look nice, they're well produced, but they have a lot more punch when you're just listening to all of them in succession. But there are some tracks, these handful of tracks, that when you pull them out they are just stand out beats. Beats that are really original for lack of a better word. Beats that I've never really heard anything like in my life. For example, the track “Lightworks” is an extremely original beat and MF DOOM used that on his latest LP “Born Like This”, that beat is partially the reason why that's my favorite track on the album, but I digress. So we have “Lightworks”, which is really strange, really odd beat just filled with these really kind of eerie tones and just the way this woman's vocal flies in and out of the track when you know that the song that was lifted from, it didn't sound quite so minor in the context that J Dilla uses it, I'm sure it was in a much brighter, much more upbeat track, but where he's using it in this song, it sounds kind of like a minor tone, just a kind of a negative thing, an eerie thing.\r
\r
Also, the track “Stop” really hit me, they had these really fantastic soulful vocals just soaring over these tonality, these really pitchy kind of drones in the background, which could have been woodwinds, could have been violins, they were kind of buried, all I know is that it kind of felt like the voices and the instrumentation behind them were sampled from two different sources and he just put them together so well. Also, the track “People” hit me as really original, just with the way that J Dilla is obviously or was obviously not afraid to play with some off-kilter rhythm to really sort of put a hip-hop element onto something that people aren't used to. Also, sort of as a side note I love the sirens all throughout this album, every time I hear it, I just get like excited. It gives this thing this really rough, raw hip-hop mixtape kind of feel, especially with all these shouting voices coming in and out, a lot of these tracks, it just really feels like this kind of underground thing that you bought from a friend or you burned off somebody or you like purchased at it at a gas station, just felt like this really kind of underground hip-hop mixtape. And it had kind of this roughness to it, it had a little bit of roughness to it, wasn't like the most cleanly produced thing on the planet, but the thing is the fact that it's rough is obviously intentional, it's obviously intentional. J Dilla has produced quite a number of clean beets in his lifetime. I mean, the fact that this thing just kind of feels like it's just sewn together, it's just kind of like just boiled into this one thing, all these beats is so intentional. And if one bleeds into another little bit, if one just kind of seems a little bit thrown together, it's kind of like a ragtag group of instrumentals, it's a rag tag group, it's like the dirty dozen, except instead of a dozen you get fucking 31.\r
\r
And as I mentioned before, there is a really prominent soul music influence throughout this thing. And I feel like on some of the tracks that hit me the most with that were the ones that had these really beautiful soulful vocal cuts in them. “One for Ghost”, which obviously is sort of a track for Ghostface Killah and he ended up using it on a song of his and named it after the vocal cut out of that, just that male vocal coming out, just really takes me back. Also, the lyrical content of the vocal cut just sort of seemed omething weird, something that you wouldn't usually hear sampled in hip-hop, something that I don't think a producer would usually want to deal with because maybe they're taking themselves too seriously. “U-Love” has some really fantastic group vocals on there. And I have to say my favorite vocal cut on the entire LP is “Lightworks”. “Last Donut of the Night” — every single time I hear the vocal cut and that last track, that second to last track right before the intro outro, I just want to rip my heart out, just want to rip my heart out and be a sad boy.\r
\r
As I mentioned before, there are some instrumentals on here that when you pull them out of the context of “Donuts”, they're okay. I can't really say there's a track on here that if I pulled it out of the context of the album I would think it's bad, especially considering that my first exposure to a lot of these songs was through listening to the entire LP all the way through. So despite that, there are still these other songs that I come back to, these other beats, ideas, these motifs that I come back to, sometimes I'll skip some other beats just to get to them, like “Lightworks”, like “People”, just because they're so strange, just because they're so original, they just tickle my ear in a certain way, they just play with my head in a certain way.\r
\r
This thing seriously grows on me with every listen, it's just so chill, it's just so relaxed, it's just so enjoyable, I can't say a bad thing about it and if I had the chance, I don't know if I would change anything about it. Maybe it's easier that said than done, but I would have loved a couple tracks in there, a couple more “Lightworks” like tracks. But other than that, just a great just a great mix of hip-hop instrumentals. I'm really glad you actually got me to sit down and listen to this, I really appreciate that. As a whole I think this thing is kind of like an anthology, obviously not of J Dilla's previous work, but an anthology of his abilities, of his ideas, of his talents as a producer. I mean, I'm not the kind of person who believes in fate or outside forces, but I think he was really fortunate, I think all of us are really fortunate that he was able to put this thing out just before he passed away.\r
