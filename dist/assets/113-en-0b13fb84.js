const e=`The new Daughters album, self-titled. Daughters are from Road Island. And at 27 minutes, this is easily their longest studio effort. This band has been labeled numerous things, mostly genres that end in "core", and have garnered comparisons to bands like The Locust, Some Girls, and I think fans of early An Albatross can appreciate Daughters music too.\r
\r
But this self-titled album is a completely different headache when compared to their earlier releases, a lot of changes on this thing. For one, the vocals, instead of screaming, instead of shrieking, it sort of seems like just shouting, forced, yelling, talking, maybe like an angry auctioneer. It reminded me of Nick Cave, especially his work with The Birthday Party, which isn't a surprise since this band contributed a track to The Birthday Party tribute album.\r

Daughters' music on this LP is no longer thrashy or sporadic like it used to be. Instead, the band uses a lot of low-end, a lot of distortion and a lot of compression to create this massive, bone-crushing sound, which is more my bread and butter as opposed to the whole trashy thing. Not to say that those earlier releases aren't worth their salt. Aggressive playing has its strong points, but I just can't believe the guitar sounds on this LP, the guitars on this thing sound like an electric evil church organ. If you get this thing out of big pair of speakers, you had better get ready for a punishment.\r
\r
Another big change on this LP is Daughters have worked to make their songs a lot longer. The longest of them just inching over four minutes. But I wouldn't say Daughters have lost their taste for brevity, because, even though there are longer songs on here, the band is constantly throwing different sounds at the listener. Whether it's guitar noise scraping against strings feedback, or some other sounds that I just can't explain. The band throws some left-hooks on certain tracks, break things up, some piercing feedback on one song, a dance beat on another song, there was one track where I heard a guitar riff that was distinctly close to something that ZZ Top did on the track "La Grange". And there's some chants and some keyboards on the closing track too. Unless you have ADD, nothing sticks around long enough for it to get old. And yet, things repeat just enough times for them to be catchy.\r
\r
This thing is noisy, it's heavy, just what I like. And I don't have any gripes other than that it made me enter in a place here and a place there.\r
