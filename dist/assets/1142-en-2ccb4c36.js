const e=`Nina Simone, songwriter accomplished pianist and one of the most unique voices in jazz music. Her deep bellowing vocals earned her hits right from the start of her career and recorded music. And even though her pop appeal did keep her album sales going, a lot of her songs and albums did have kind of a darker side to them. A mournful side or even a politically charged message like the track “Mississippi Goddam” or her infamous cover of Billie Holiday's “Strange Fruit”, which lands on this LP. Nina was also early to cover songs like Screamin' Jay Hawkins' “I Put A Spell On You”, as well as “House of the Rising Sun”. She's put out a lot of songs throughout her career that relate to her heritage or love on the rocks. She never really shied away from tracks whose subject matter was really cynical or biting toward popular culture like “Marriage Is For Old Folks”. But she was also not really a stranger to jazz standards and traditional songs and love songs.\r
\r
Which is true of this LP right here as well, “Pastel Blues”, an LP who from its title you might guess is a blues album. Blues does seem to be a basis for a lot of the chord progressions on this LP and what I also like about this album is that Nina sticks very closely to her quartet of guest musicians that accompany her, sort of sidestepping a lot of the heavily orchestrated vocal pop that she had done before on her previous records that was sort of popular during this time period.\r
\r
And the first track on here is especially stripped back — “Be My Husband”, a song that was allegedly written by Nina's husband and features nothing but her voice clapping and a hi-hat. And the melody she's singing on this track and the way that she delivers it vocally, it just feels like an old spiritual in this track because of a stripped back it is instrumentally it's just a really great display of how fantastic her vocals are. She howls, she moans, she croons her way through this song in a really emotive way. Jumping up and down her vocal range and the moments when she reaches her highest notes. These ad-libs sound amazing and have her sounding more like trumpet than a human being. She had such a unique vocal and it's interesting that they would take a song that is that is this skeletal and put it first right at the beginning of the album. This song gives away to a Bessie Smith's track “Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out”, which was originally recorded in the 1930s. The song has a very bluesy instrumental that plays it very straight, which happens with a few other tracks on here — “Trouble In Mind”, “Chilly Wind Don't Blow” and “Ain't No Use” — these tracks even though they are solid songs, the instrumentation is a little lacking and surprises, especially considering how great of a pianist Nina was. Though, her playing and her improvisation on the last of those three tracks is great. Still, this is pretty forgivable especially on this Bessie Smith track because it tells a story that is as old as time in such a heartfelt way. Everyone's there for the party as long as your foot in the bill, but as soon as you're broke everyone's vanished. And not only is it a good tune, not only are the lyrics really vivid and telling, but Nina's vocals are especially powerful on the turnaround on the back end of this song.\r

The song “Trouble In Mind” is another catchy tune attract that lyrically visits a very familiar blues theme that, you know, bad times today, but maybe things will be better tomorrow. Very good track and, you know, not to give more credit to the drearier songs on this LP, but they really are where Nina feels her boldest on this record. Her vocal performance on the track “End Of The Line” is absolutely chilling, hearing her singing with such a heavy vibrato while pushing herself into the deepest lows of her range, of her vocal range. Plus, the very nimble piano chords and arpeggios dipping in and out in the background adds a lot of drama to the tune. And again, that vibrato, it's no wonder she's been such a heavy influence on people like Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu, an indie band that recently put out a covers album of songs that she had written or recorded and performed throughout her career.\r
\r
Another slower track on here that I love — “Tell Me More And More And Then Some”, the song is a bit of harmonica back blues has a pace that is slow as molasses and it is a sultry back alley track, moonlit night, light breeze, leaves falling temperatures in the low 50s, it's like that. The bass and the drums on this track are shadowy just hanging in the background like a stalker. The harmonica chiming in and disappearing just as fast as it came like a car driving by in the distance. And I love the way that Nina fills in the spaces and the silence with her voice. And the piano chord, she just swipes at the silence so aggressively and she really sort of picks her shots sparingly.\r
\r
And my favorite tracks on this thing are easily the two that this LP ends off with. First, her infamous cover of the song “Strange Fruit”, the second Billie Holiday track to make it onto this LP. A song that is really one of the most vivid and stomach-churning depictions of lynching in the southern United States and Nina Simone does it unspeakable justice. And instrumentally she really values space again on this song a lot like the other Billie Holiday track here and it just makes the incredibly mournful lyrics on this song, even more empowered. And the way Nina is singing on this song, the way she's a moding on this track it just makes the topic feel so much more sinister and unspeakable.\r
\r
The closing track on here “Sinnerman”, which “Strange Fruit” sort of glides into pretty seamlessly is easily the longest track here, ten minutes long, and does not really feel boring or long-winded, not for a single beat. Nina and her band pulled together a really powerful rendition of this traditional song and they moved through multiple phases of this track too, with Nina and her band just gaining more momentum and intensity with their playing as the track progresses, it's really easy to get wrapped up and how they're playing off of one another in this song, especially as the background vocals are boiling up. And as the song moves along, the starts and stops, the drum fills, the drum improvisations, Nina been propping a little on her piano with clapping happening in the background. Though the tune is good, it's just really hearing these people play together, so passionately that makes this song great and hearing Simone push her vocal range to the outer limits on the very end of the track, it just makes for such a powerful and moving finish.\r
\r
Overall, “Pastel Blues” is a really solid set of songs for Nina Simone. A great starting point if you haven't really listened to a full-length album of hers yet and a great display of her vocal abilities if you're really looking to get up close and personal with this really amazing voice.\r
