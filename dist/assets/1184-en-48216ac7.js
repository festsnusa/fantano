const e=`This self-titled record is the 4th full-length LP from singer-songwriter and guitarist, extraordinaire Annie Clark, whose music deals heavily in art pop, chamber pop, indie pop with each new release getting a little more abrasive, abstract, experimental, a little noisy. Not too harsh, not too experimental, because on some of St. Vincent's best records like “Actor” and “Strange Mercy” she maintained her pop appeal. I think Annie sort of hit a creative peak on her last LP with a number of songs like “Cruel”, and “Cheerleader” and “Northern Lights” — tracks that bring buzzing, bulky and sometimes brittle guitars together with Annie's beautiful voice and some really heavenly effervescent strings and synths. So, thus far I've never really had a reason not to be excited for a new St. Vincent record, especially with each new album getting a shade weirder. And I've been head over heels for nearly every song that is dropped from this LP thus far — songs like “Digital Witness” and “Birth in Reverse”, tracks that are lyrically and conceptually clever, and instrumentally glitchy, textured and groove wise, sort of perky jerky. The song “Birth in Reverse” has all these really jagged punchy guitar riffs that remind me of something sort of like off of one of the first two Devo records, but pushed past the edge of insanity.\r
\r
And a lot like Devo, the music here is most definitely rock, but very electronically tinged. There are drums on this record that sound live and sound intense, but there are moments here where the beats feel sort of looped or stiff, or even synthetic. Maybe a feel that sort of carried over from the recent collaboration St. Vincent did with David Byrne. There are really prominent synthesizers all over this record and the guitars wild, I mean, they sound like guitars, for the most part they are just cooked down to the point where many of the guitar tones that you just feel like nothing but ultra grimy digital distortion. It's interesting that some of Annie's most animalistic lyrics and vocal deliveries land on such cold rigid instrumentation.\r
\r
While, there are some songs on here that have a great grooves and are really catchy, like “Digital Witness”, I think for the most part St. Vincent tries to intentionally suck the viscera out of rock music. And for the most part, I think it's a really great success like with the opener here “Rattlesnake”, where the drums feel like they're being played through a sewer pipe. There's some really rough distorted synths sequences that are pretty funky playing throughout the track too, and then on top of that, there are all these sound effects littered across the song, but even in all of this chaos we get a really catchy concise tune that does a great job of setting the tone for the record.\r
\r
And to mention “Digital Witness” again, maybe my favorite track on this entire LP, really smart lyrical satire about the internet generations vanity. This track has one of the grooviest bass lines and rhythms on the entire LP and it's easily one of the most colorful songs on this thing too, even though there are a lot of sounds on here that feel so rough and just manipulated heavily. The grimy guitars and synths sits really nicely against the horns and Annie's beautiful vocal harmonies.\r
\r
The harder and poppier tracks on this record for me impress again and again, like with the song “Huey Newton” a song that I wasn't too in love with at first, but eventually the very beautiful unsuspecting intro grew on me and the way that it explodes into one of the heaviest riffs on the entire album in the second half is really gratifying. And with the song “Regret”, the guitar riff being played throughout this track feels like a Led Zeppelin riffs sort of turned inside out retweet for a noise pop record, which I guess it is. I love the blissful hook on this track too, I think it's a really beautiful contrast from the distorted heavier spots on this track, even though I do think St. Vincent is putting out her most experimental record yet here, I don't think she loses sight of making sure she balances these harsher moments out with at least some elements of beauty. And I also love the song “Psychopath”, one of my favorite tunes on this record and I love the really repetitive driving krautrock-esque beat on this thing too.\r
\r
I think the only song on this record, where Annie really goes overboard a little bit is on “Bring Me Your Lovers”, which essentially sounds like an alien race of St. Vincent's coming down and violently abducting everyone in a spaceship to take them off into a very faraway galaxy to love them until the end of time. But the music itself feels so hellish with it's grimy bass lines and tractor beam synthesiser leads. Annie manipulates her vocals on this track pretty heavily with a very dissonant chorus vocal hanging in the background and then the rhythm on this track is like a combination between a marching band and an amazonian drum circle. And the lyrics on this track, maybe some of the most eye widening or gripping on this entire LP in that, they are very forceful and subtly kinky. Part of me feels like this track is just freakish fun, other parts of me sort of leaves a bad taste in my ears. Either way, I think they're really apocalyptic ethereal synthesizers toward the back end of this track, really sort of brings this cacophonous instrumentation together really nicely.\r
\r
However, the zaniness really takes over on the track “Every Tear Disappears”, which has one of the weirdest instrumentals on this entire LP. And along the way, in making this mess of a musical backdrop, St. Vincent fails to bring a decent tune. Not only are the farty synthesizers and the really stiff drums not that interesting, but hearing St. Vincent's sings so beautifully over this instrumental just feels kind of awkward. I guess there are moments on this LP where really harsh rigid cold backdrops of music fit against the very human vocals create an interesting mix.\r
\r
I think that's the case for nearly every single ballad too on this LP unfortunately. Songs like “Prince Johnny”, “I Prefer Your Love”. I love the tunes on these tracks and I think St. Vincent does a great job of singing on them as well. Not to mention that “I Prefer Your Love” is probably one of the more lyrically gripping tracks on this LP too. But when Annie is singing on these tracks in search of that theatrical spotlight that's typically there in her songs, the instrumentation in the background is just way too stiff to embrace her and lift her up where she belongs. The closest I think St. Vincent comes to doing a great ballad with this colder icier style is the closing track on here, which, despite its very stiff instrumentation, is also sort of heavenly and pastel-colored. It's very synth, heavy like many other songs on here, but there are some great vocal harmonies, some huge ringing bells in the background and some wonderful plucked arpeggios too. And all of these things fill in the gaps that are typically there on some of the more toned-down songs here. It's also a song where I find myself sort of curious and wanting to dig into the backstory behind the lyrics on this track too.\r
\r
Overall, I did like this LP. I think this record has some of her best songs yet, but also easily one of her worst. And while, I admire St. Vincent greatly for coming together with this really experimental pop and rock record, not every experiment in my opinion goes over really well. I do prefer “Actor” to this. I do really prefer “Strange Mercy” to this, which still continues to be my favorite St. Vincent record, but I don't really feel terribly let down by what happened on this LP, I did get at least a few of what I think are some of the best songs of the year out of it.\r
