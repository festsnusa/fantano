const t=`This is Flying Lotus' "Pattern+Grid World" EP. Flying Lotus is a California music producer, who's made a huge splash this year with his last album "Cosmogramma".\r
\r
7 tracks, almost 19 minutes and just over 5 bucks. And people like me, who maybe didn't take to the slow-burning nature of Flying Lotus' last album, should hop on to this EP pretty quickly. It's straightforward to the point like Flying Lotus' second LP "Los Angeles", but without being dark or brooding. I have no clue where these tracks came from, they could totally be throw aways from "Cosmogramma", maybe these tracks weren't cosmic enough, I don't know. But if that is true, it wouldn't be surprising considering how close this releases to that album. I could see a couple of these tracks sliding into moments on "Cosmogramma" very easily.\r
\r
Like the opening track, which is very chill, a little jazzy as well, I love the aesthetic, the vibe that track gives off. If that song was ready in time for "Cosmogramma", it might have made a nice replacement for one of its many interludes. But that's just me. But even if this EP is a little bit of "Cosmogramma" run off, it still stands well on its own very well. The tracks don't fade into each other, each one has its own thing going on, which is nice if you're looking for something that is experimental, but also light and easy to listen to.\r
\r
My favorite moment by far on this EP is the song "Kill Your Co-Workers", second track on this EP, it's got this beat that's almost warm and synths rise up very slowly, like a sunrise or something. And they sound a little bit like flutes almost, but the track eventually bursts into this beat, heavy set of 8-bit fireworks. It's like a more colourful, more melodic approach to the whole breakbeat thing. The chill moments on this thing go over really well too, like "Time Vampires", which is extremely hypnotic. And the song "Camera Day" has a great beat, but the melodies over it feel so soothing, relaxing.\r
\r
For me, it hits a few issues. The song "Jurassic Notion / M Theory" doesn't end all that pretty. And the track "PieFace" is maybe a little repetitive, monotonous. Still, the toy box of sounds that Flying Lotus is playing with on this thing is no less varied, no less gripping, no less interesting than anything he's put out in the past, just as interesting as listening to J Dilla's "Donuts".\r
\r
The songs are a little shorter than I would have wanted them to be, but it's an EP, can't expect too much of it, it's not a full-length album, it's not a full meal, it's a snack, its price like a snack. It's about the length of a snack. If you come into this expecting a long, mind-blowing change of direction in Flying Lotus's music, that's not going to be here. But the sounds, the eccentricity, the beats, everything we've come to know and love from this guy is here. Just because this thing is short, it doesn't mean Flying Lotus has skipped out on the quality.\r
\r
Your general underground or experimental hip-hop fan, your general electronic music fan, I wouldn't say you'd be missing out if he didn't listen to this thing. However, I'll say that is the case for a Flying Lotus fan. Because of the nice price, because of the decent songs, it's not mind blowing, but highly enjoyable.\r
