const e=`Death Grips is a Sacramento based experimental hip hop trio, consisting of producer Flatlander, percussionist/producer/songwriter Zach Hill and MC Ride vocalist, crazy man. They've been turning the underground on its head since the release of 2011 “Exmilitary”, their debut mixtape, which delivered noisy, visceral, industrial hip-hop with a punk ethos. And even though Death Grips came through with this incredibly aggressive and unwavering, uncompromising sound, they actually went on to find quite a bit of diversity in their style with subsequent albums, like the very catchy and I think their poppiest and my favorite album in their discography “The Money Store”, the incredibly electronic “No Love Deep Web”, the sort of odd and short and very instrumental “Government Plates”, they also had that instrumental album that dropped in the midst of the two discs of this new double LP “The Powers That B”, the first disc of which came out last year and was definitely Death Grips most abstract set of tracks yet. Loaded with dizzying rhythms, Bjork's vocal samples, songs that had really unusual structures to them. Yet, all the tracks segwayed into one another, making the entire LP feel like one cohesive piece. And this record wasn't a bad listen, but since it was announced as the first half of a double album, Death Grips essentially kept fans waiting like almost a year for the second half of this double LP. “JENNY DEATH WHEN” has essentially been the rallying cry of nail-biting fans all throughout 2014, fans that might not be 100% aware of the BDSM style relationship Death Grips has with its listeners and the music industry in general.\r
\r
Death Grips does give its listeners pleasure through explosive, genre defying music. But there's also disappointment and tension building and thirst building that Death Grips actively engages in with their fans and the music industry through canceled shows, the way that they interact with their fans in the industry so elusively and stand offishly from social media and message boards, leaking the “No Love Deep Web” album, which got them dropped from Epic Records, also putting a penis on that album cover, making fans wait this long for “Jenny Death”, the sudden breakup they announced scrolled down on a napkin. Although, just recently on Facebook they said that they might make more. More what, I don't know. And then the fact that they just said “we might”, because just breaking up and staying broken up is just far too define the decision for Death Grips, just always wanting to keep people on the edge of their seats.\r
\r
However, we are right now at a point of release, because the second half of “The Powers That B”has been dropped, “Jenny Death”. Which has a very different feel to its sister album that I will sort of go back to and talk a little bit about toward the end of this review. But as far as “Jenny Death” goes, for a record that has been anticipated for as long as “Jenny Death” has, it does a pretty decent job of living up to the hype. There are no Bjork samples on this record and Death Grips essentially is back to their incredibly hard-hitting selves with a series of very succinct songs that work better as singles, individual tracks and they do as a holistic piece. Death Grips comes through with a load of crushing powerful choruses on this record. And for the first time, Death Grips is not only embodying that punk attitude with just that really confrontational outward appearance, but they're actually embodying punk music in sound as well on this project by bringing quite a bit of original guitars into the mix.\r
\r
there's a good chunk of songs on this album that features some prominent guitars that are kind of brittle in tone, some of the riffs are a little hardcore inspired. “Jenny Death” is one of Death Grips catchiest, most upfront and sonically potent records yet. And it all kicks off with the song “I Break Mirrors With My Face in the United States”, wonderful title. And this track feels like just a speedy bustling hard-hitting piece of cyberpunk, like Atari Teenage Riot inspired. There are some very nutty and just very textured percussion in the background, wailing tones and over it Stefan, MC Ride is just yelling manically. Death Grips is one of the few bands out there to embrace the digital age with such an incredible amount of grit. And the way I interpret this track is that we have Death Grips smashing mirrors, reflections of reality and sort of pulling their listeners into the Internet, because the Internet is kind of Death Grips den of horrors. Now, I'm not gonna say this track is amazing songwriting wise, but lyrically and sonically it is fantastic start to this record and it is a fantastic manifesto for “Jenny Death”.\r
\r
We glide from this track into “Inanimate Sensation”, which in my track review for that track I talked about how this song was sort of about fake digital feelings, again we have Death Grips here kind of rejecting reality, talking about later in this track how Stefan likes his iPod more than fucking. There are also nods to rock machismo at some points of this track and with the kind of romping drum beat on this song and the constantly escalating electronic sounds in the background that are very textured, kind of distorted along with the screaming vocals is all at once. These constantly revving sounds is just another example of Death Grips with each record always trying something new, always onto something different, finding another way to make something completely whacked out and also blood pumping. And when the lyrics initially kick in on this track, it's like the band has just reached through the speakers, run their fists into my ear canal and just kind of swishing my brain around and beating it, until it's a lump of goop. And this might kind of go unnoticed, because of how electrifying and aggressive this song is, but what this tracks multiple parts, the really great refrain below. And the intense finish how each part of this song has a different kind of feel to it, Death Grips really are pretty skilled songwriters.\r
\r
Now, with the song “Turned Off” we actually have the guitars kind of taking over for a little bit, these just burnt brittle guitars. The chorus is incredibly hard-hitting, has this hardcore inspired riff, but it's also very psychedelic with Stefan's vocals kind of soaked in echo. This track and many other songs on this record are really overwhelming, there's a lot of layers of different sounds all together, but it doesn't stop Death Grips from having a lot of punch. There are spots where I felt like the guitars and the drums could have been a little bit more defined, maybe they sort of just muddy each other a little bit, it also feels like there's a bit of an electronic buzz running throughout some parts of this track too. But MC Ride's vocals just really pop out of this track, delivering some of his most insane lyrics yet, talking about that he's been spinning chambers since he was a little kid, that he smoked cigarettes in the shower when they get wet he lights another, he prefers a cardiac attack over cancer to just sort of have a quick death.\r
\r
There are actually a lot of references to death and suicide on this record, which given the title of “Jenny Death”, it's not really that surprising. And it is a Death Grips record too. It's also worth noting that as far as the energy behind Stefan's performance on this track, it's a pretty immense at times, especially when he sort of squelches out from his vocal chords. Moving on from here, we have “Why a Bitch Gotta Lie”, which kind of continues that cyberpunk aesthetic that the first track kicked off with. But it kind of takes it a step further with this oddly danceable beat on the chorus and some vocal effects that feel kind of vocoder-esque, definitely results in this really unreadable and very loud and in-your-face robot voice throughout much of this song, which kind of kills interpreting these lyrics without going out and reading them, but it actually adds a really interesting sonic texture for this track that really makes it stick out. We also have them on this song and others here too, a laughing, very menacingly, to the point where it is very creepy. And there are moments in the lyrics here, where Death Grips are kind of tooting their own horn a little bit, getting kind of braggadocious saying “try and tame” and sort of putting forward this idea that Death Grips is a kind of animalistic and limitless. Again, we kind of had these heavy, hardcore riffs on the chorus here and I just feel like I'm listening to so many genres of music crashed together at once — hip hop and punk music and electronic music and and psychedelic music as well. Yet, they're all working together so cohesively.\r
\r
Death Grips continues to be this mind-blowing Frankenstein monster of a different musical genres and that is only highlighted even further with the next track “Pss Pss”. Which is an oddly danceable and maybe even a twerk worthy beat, kind of off-kilter hip-hop. It's really messed up the way this track sounds, it's kind of groovy, but also mutant like. And lyrically, we actually get a few references to tracks off of the first half of “The Powers That B”. The song “Fuck Me Out” and “Have a Sad Cum”. In a way I think the chorus here kind of highlights the cheapness of sex and maybe brings a little bit of context to “Have a Sad Cum”, but there's also kind of a demented edge to this track too, making reference to pissing on someone's face in the chorus[track “Pss Pss”]. And the title track of this record, I will leave it simply by saying this is Death Grips loudest song, it's just so freakin' blown out and this burst of volume is only emphasized by Ride's lyrics right beforehand saying “I can't know what I'm bout to do”. And some of the lyrics toward the back end of this track actually signaled to me really what Death Grips has been about all along philosophically, aesthetically, comparing their competition to like a sterilized white flag.\r
\r
I've never heard Death Grips glow so much on a record, but with how hard-hitting “Jenny Death” is, they have quite a bit of reason to glow. Because they definitely do make a lot of really abrasive music and just even normal regular everyday music seem very wimpy and measly and maybe even inauthentic, even though to an extent I'm sure what Death Grips delivers to us time and time again on each album is enacted, as a stage show it is a performance, but there's something just really real and tangible about it too, tangible about the aggression and the extremity of it.\r
\r
Now sadly, the record actually goes into what I think is my least favorite track in the tracklisting here, “Beyond Alive”, where I actually find the guitar parts of this track to be kind of weak. This album to me is a lot like the first half of “The Powers That Be” in that we kind of have this sort of one instrument or sound that is a bit of a recurring theme on a lot of the tracks, there was Bjork's voice, here it is this guitar. And a lot like with the inclusion of Bjork's vocals, this guitar's inclusion isn't always fantastic. The diddling theme melody that pops up again and again gets a little stale. And while I don't mind the distorted fight riff that builds up to the chorus and the hard-hitting chorus as well, but as soon as the distortion gets sucked out of the guitars and we're kind of getting these watery, kind of slinky guitar chords that are pretty mild and mid-paced, the guitars really lose a lot of flavor and energy for me. And despite the really anthemic string like melody on the track “Centuries of Damn”, as well as some really immense lyrics too, this track is not really without its blemishes as well, with some very kind of a pathetically droning loud blaring guitar chords, there's two chords kind of switching back and forth that I don't really bring much if anything to the song the track really could have done without them.\r
\r
However, these guitars really make a comeback on the track “On GP”. Which is another track from this tracklisting here that I did an individual track review for, I said it was Death Grips most depressing track, suicidally themed and in a way kind of ballad-like, maybe even the closest to a ballad Death Grips will ever get. There's a really fantastic lead guitar melody on this track that is very hard rock influenced, maybe even just a little Led Zeppelin-esque. Some chilling organs on this track too and some amazing and almost frightening lyrics delivered by Stefan during the more toned-down moments of this song. The track sounds better in the tracklisting here then it did by itself.\r
\r
But the entire record actually finishes off with this really weird, nutty, kind of industrial, somewhat techno influenced instrumental, “Death Grips 2.0”. Which isn't really that satisfying of a closing to this album, I think “On GP” would have made for a better finish. But still, I think “Death Grips 2.0” is more of a message than it is a song for a few different reasons. One, this track kind of sounds like what could be the background music for some kind of fantastic bit of film at the end of a really great movie, sort of showing “a-ha, the bad guy, the monster, he's not dead, he's back” and then some crazy “to be continued…” sign flashes in front of the audience's eyes, saying “uh, there's gonna be more on the way”. The music really has that kind of tone to it, there's also the fact that the ending is so abrupt and this track overall does kind of feel like a cliffhanger. And just to think about the title of this track too, “Death Grips 2.0”, are they're saying that this album was “Death Grips 2.0”? Maybe, but the way that I read it, is that “Death Grips 2.0” is on the way.\r
\r
Now, as far as the first half of “The Powers That Be”, I'm not going to get too deep into it, if you really want to know some more defined thoughts on each individual track I recommend checking out my older review of that record. I still think it's a great project, which I was kind of afraid to put a score on and have too many definitive thoughts about until I had heard “Jenny Death”. And I will say, even though I do enjoy it, I don't think “Jenny Death” is really making me rethink it at all. Outside of a few tracks that are blatantly referenced on “Pss Pss”. To me, really these are two very different albums, I mean “Jenny Death” has some very bold upfront in-your-face themes and concepts going on and the lyrics dealing with the digital world and death, these two records flow very differently. There are two very different lengths as well, they're aesthetically different, they take two very different approaches to song structuring as well, one album of tracks being very abstract and obtuse and difficult to make sense of, the other having very defined verses and choruses, a lot of the tracks being incredibly catchy and visceral. These two albums only feel like a double album in the fact that they've been billed as a double album. I really don't think these two albums enhance one another, at least not in any kind of traditional way, maybe in a sense they highlight and make very apparent their differences and maybe in the world of Death Grips that's exactly what makes them perfect sister albums. You have Death Grips' most ambiguous release, stapled to one of the most direct records yet, both coming together for over 80 minutes of mind-bending insanity. And maybe separating these two albums wasn't the worst thing in the world, because with this album being so difficult, maybe it did take a little bit more time to digest.\r
\r
Kind of wrestle with this album, make heads or tails of it and also come to appreciate how uninterpretable this album is and how absurd some of the parts of this record are, especially the end of “Voila”, “Big Dipper” and “Fuck Me Out”. Still though, I don't think this record is without its potholes, the Bjork samples do get a little incessant, and I still do think the start of “Black Quarterback” is unnecessarily cluttered. However, I think these two records actually end up, adding up to one of the most impressive records in Death Grips discography so far.\r
