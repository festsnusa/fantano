const e=`Women, Canadian band, second album “Public Strain”. In 2008 these guys came out with a self-titled LP and that thing wasn't one of my favorites of that year. However, the band's sound had stuck in my head, which is kind of funny because they're really not the easiest band to define. Although, I could try, I would call this garage gone sour with a deep affection for art rock and noise. I don't know, I guess if you were going to slap a genre name on it or something the words post or wave would probably be in it. I mean, you could just call post-wave. After that 2008 LP, I assumed that Women would just refine their sound, come out with another LP and they have, they definitely have, just not in the way I expected them to.\r

Usually when a band refines their sound, it's sort of like sticking to one idea or getting catchy or getting more immediate. For me, “Public Strain” is a huge left hook, with 11 little left hooks packed into it. This album just refuses to be normal and Women doesn't do that, they don't accomplish that by being completely noisy, they kind of do something worse, they flirt with the idea of being sunny and sweet and then suddenly they just jam a wrench into the gears and shake them around. Oh wait, here's a pop song, here's a verse, here's a chorus, there's a melody, oh wait, here comes a sour note, now there's a lot of noise in the background, here some drone. Oh, you want a rock song? Okay, here's a beat. Oh, wait a second, it's like in 13/8, why would you do that? Oh, dissonant chords. Why this mesmerizing jam, why all these eerie deadpan creepy vocals?\r

The thing is, no matter what on every single track, Women find a different way to not be accessible and beat expectations. And if there's any consistent idea or theme on this LP, it is that. The production is also pretty consistent and I absolutely love it. A lot of moments on “Public Strain” are messy and cacophonous, but also very labored over and detailed as well. Women are always throwing different ideas into the mix, different sounds, at your ears but, there are also tracks that go in the opposite direction on this thing, where they are trying to put as little sound into the mix as possible, just very bleak, just the sound of of emptiness. Even track “Bells”, which is a three-minute drone, which sounds like it was produced with an organ, has a certain kind of charm to it that I can't deny.\r

Now, a lot of people will call this record lo-fi and maybe I wouldn't go that far, it's not the most lo-fi thing on the block, though it does sound self-recorded and it is. But if calling it lo-fi will get you to check out the record, it's lo-fi. If some comparisons will get you to check this out, it kind of reminds me of Eric's Trip if maybe they were going for a creepier vibe, or maybe even Woods if they decided they wanted to be a rock band. It's something that on a lot of tracks on here I'm just totally feeling Velvet Underground, but not in the sense that they sound exactly like the Velvets, but maybe in the sense that it's very otherworldly, very kind of off-putting. Part of me wants to kind of call it druggie, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's druggie, because in the same breath it's also kind of sobering in how desolate this album feels.\r
\r
This thing really does create a lot of tension for me and it's because it's difficult to define, that just kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat, it's just really dark, it's just really restless, kind of like a fat bald guy in a night robe sitting in his living room with the TV on and lights off, shaking in his recliner with a coffee and a cigarette. But I want to say this is for a specific listener, if you're looking for a straightforward easygoing pop record, don't go here, if you're looking for something electronic, something that's clean and well parsed, don't go here. But if you want something that is strange, off-kilter, a little far out, something that's just going to make your eyes go wide with a spooky beauty, then look no further. I have little to no gripes with this thing, it gets a little underwhelming at points, the first track isn't my favorite.\r
