const e=`This is the new The Tallest Man On Earth EP epically titled "Sometimes the Blues Is Just a Passing Bird". If you want more background, more context on The Tallest Man On Earth, I recommend watching my review for his previous LP "The The Wild Hunt", just months away from the release of that extremely well-received album we have 5 tracks of "The Wild Hunt" afterthoughts here on this new EP.\r
\r
Overall, the artistic mindset of singer-songwriter folk artist Kristian Matsson isn't too far from where it was on "The Wild Hunt". You've got warm acoustic guitar, the perfect amount of reverb on the vocals and just a great ballad, just classy stuff, even on songs where I'm not all that captivated by the melody. The opener being an example, Kristian still catches me with his lyrics, I just find myself hanging on this guy's words. And it's because he's so descriptive, the words that he uses are so visual, hearing it is seeing it when it comes to his lyrics. And there are moments on these 5 tracks that are just as impressive as anything on any Tallest Man album. The song "Like the Wheel" is an example, and that is an extremely strong song, I love the tone, the emotion of that thing, it's like having the the sun hit your face on the perfect spring day. There's some very faint piano keys in the background of that song, and I'm pretty sure I hear a dog barking here and there too. But accompaniment, a surprising and subtle shift away from what people may be used to on other Tallest Man track, the very skeletal, acoustic guitar and vocals combo.\r
\r
And we have another surprise on one track. The song "The Dreamer" actually has electric guitar. Of course, it's still very soft and easygoing and not hard on the ears at all. But it's just a nice change of pace for The Tallest Man. There are multitrack guitar melodies tinkling in the background, as well as a few swells, I guess you can call them, with one big guitar chord casting out with a lot of reverb on it.\r
\r
If "The Wild Hunt" is going to be one of your albums of the year for 2010, I highly suggest that you give this a listen, this is a must, an absolute must for people who are that down with The Tallest Man On Earth, for anybody who is into acoustic music, into folk music and is maybe curious about The Tallest Man On Earth. This is nice, but I suggest starting with an album of his instead. Because 5 tracks to me is just not enough material to understand the depth of this guy's talent.\r
