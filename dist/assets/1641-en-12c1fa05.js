const e=`FKA Twigs is an UK-based singer-songwriter, dancer, artist of multiple mediums. In my opinion, really one of the most intriguing artists out of there right now. She came through with some pretty interesting musical ideas on her initial EPs and some of these tracks, while they were really intriguing, they were also kind of short of breath, but on her debut LP, which dropped not too long ago, you should really give it a listen LP1, she complimented these really abstract approaches to art pop , and R&B and trip-hop with some really great songs. She was somehow able to make her music catchier, more accessible, while also maintaining this very abstract outward appearance. And a lot of the tracks on this record were quite erotic as well. I just loved the really odd digital atmospheres on this record and the kind of alluring songs, and the just slow-burning vibe of this record, and the kind of sexual lyrics here, I was really excited to sort of see where FKA Twigs was going to develop this sound on subsequent releases.\r
\r
And now, all of a sudden, out of the blue, we have the release of this brand-new EP titled M3LL155X (as for Melissa) and it's a five track affair, but we have built up to the release of this EP with two songs that were put out previously — the song “Figure 8”, which was released not too long ago as a single, and then we have the song “Glass & Patron”, which was released as a track/music video during the YouTube Music Awards earlier this year. And it was kind of complemented with this somewhat messy gaudy music video that I think distracted away from just how good this song actually is.\r
\r
To go through these tracks, song “Figure 8” — I thought sort of a conceptually wasn't really anything too new for Twigs, but it did have some kind of strange sounds and experiments laced into the instrumental here, the kind of twittering, sputtering, glitchy percussion playing throughout this track and the kind of moaning bass. The heavy walls of digital fuzz on this track were a really nice touch too and there's some strange like spoken-word passages in the second half. Again, Twigs does take some risks, sonic risks on this track that I thought were cool, it's a decent song, I just wish it had a strong ending — really an ending at all — it just kind of just finishes abruptly out of nowhere.\r
\r
But the following cut, “I'm Your Doll” is actually maybe my favorite song on here and one of the better written songs FKA Twigs has to date — really catchy. And on the highly sexual lyrics on this track, Twigs is sounding really vulnerable and I love how the instrumental on this cut just grows to a massive size toward the end of the track — it's a heavy, woozy, sexy and memorable song.\r
\r
The songs “In Time” and “Glass & Patron” though, kind of break this EP streak thus far of coming through with these tracks that just have a very soft touch. These two songs, tracks three and four, are actually way more direct. I would actually say, on the lyrics and just her singing as well on the song “In Time”, Twigs comes off pretty frustrated, which is the first time I've heard her kind of take that tone in a song and actually like it. I think this track goes over really well, especially with the instrumental here, which has a slight trap flavor, but of course, even though the twittering high hats are here and then the huge base, the whole instrumental itself is very out there. There's this weird auto-tune or sort of chorus effect on Twigs' voice on a lot of parts to this track, that's really ear grabbing, but it is tasteful, it's not like goofy or ridiculous or anything like that. The song in a way actually reminds me of a Travis Scott, if he back to his experiments with actually good songs and interesting ideas.\r
\r
And the song “Glass & Patron”, the sped up vocals on this track, it reminds me a little bit of PC Music, their production style, but ultimately this is an entirely different kind of song — Twith a really weird dance groove under the where we have twigs sort of reciting this very whispery line “pose for me”, it's like a Madonna's “Vogue” for a new era. The instrumental on this cut really sounds like it's coming from another dimension, or like a dance club where no one is dancing, because everybody is like too weird or pretentious, or something. But altogether, it is still a really enjoyable song.\r
\r
The closing track on here “Mothercreep” is actually a very well written track as well and has a few catchy refrains worked into another instrumental that — it just seems like the further I go into this record, the weird off-kilter minimalist approach taking on these beats gets weirder and weirder.\r
\r
I really loved this EP, I thought it was a killer. FKA Twigs really came through with a good release on this one, not that LP one wasn't good, but I feel like she took that songwriting ability and she translated it to an EP. Like I said, her earlier EPs, I think she surpassed those with this new EP over here, mostly because the abstract ideas are here just like on those EPs, but there's also some good songs in the tracklist here as well. And I think she's just continuing to develop her sound and do strange things with it. I don't think these tracks are as conventional as a lot of the cuts off of LP1, maybe that'll turn off some people, but the listeners who really appreciate Twigs for her abstract ideas, her erotic lyrics and her great singing voice, will appreciate what she has to to bring to the table on a M3LL155X.\r
