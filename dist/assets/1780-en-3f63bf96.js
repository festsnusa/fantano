const e=`Radiohead is a widely known alternative and art rock band hailing from the UK. They've put out a load of widely praised albums, at least when it comes to the indie scene, underground rock scene, the music writer crowd. This album has been repeatedly requested by viewers like you in the comments section for a future classic segment. So hey, I had to oblige.\r
\r
Now, this is one of Radiohead's two most popular records. The album that preceded this "OK Computer" was a last hurrah for the band. It was the final album that the band would release in the 90s, closing out the decade that Radiohead broke through within. Thanks to singles like "Creep" off of their debut full-length album "Pablo Honey", which, thanks to all of the musical progression Radiohead has made over the course of their career, a lot of fans don't look back onto that album very fondly. Mostly because the alt-rock and the grunge sound Radiohead was playing with in the 90s was sort of a trend that they evolved out of down the road. And "OK Computer" was the last taste of this sound that Radiohead and their fans would have before they would go into a more abstract and experimental and electronic direction, with records like ""Kid A"". And when it comes to measuring up "Kid A" and "OK Computer", this is the record that I prefer. I'm not a big fan of "Pablo Honey" either, and a lot of Radiohead's 90's material after that was too sluggish and mid-paced and melancholy to be exciting for me from beginning to end. Though, there are certainly highlights in Radiohead's 90's discography, it was the 2000s that I found to be the more exciting era in Radiohead's career — "In Rainbows", "Amnesiac" and especially over here "Kid A".\r

And on this LP Radiohead would be fusing the very sad and melancholy songwriting that they were known for with a lot of other music style, shades of IDM. Like on the song "Idioteque". There's also the track "Treefingers" in the middle of this LP, which is nice little, serene,beautiful ambient interlude. So, the band diversifies their sound on this record, but there are moments where they play to their strengths as well. Like on the track "How to Disappear Completely", which could have fit pretty snugly into that "OK Computer" track listening if not for the very sour and ominous strings looming in the background, filling up the space around very skeletal stripped back acoustic ballad. And there are plenty of tracks on here, like "Morning Bell", which are undeniably rock songs at their core, though they do have a strong emphasis on repetition, sort of in this kraut-rock-ian sense, maybe even a little bit of a Velvet Underground or some Talking Heads influence there too. But that's the thing about the rhythms on this album. The grooves on this album, they're either electronic and sequenced or, if they are performed live, they are delivered in the tightest, most looped performance as possible. And considering this it's not surprising to hear that in interviews Thom Yorke saw quite a bit of merit in albums like DJ Shadows' "Endtroducing....."" or the more introspective side of electronic music in the 90s. Because certainly elements of those things show up on here big time. "Kid A" provides an interesting bridge between these worlds of experimental and art-rock and electronic music. From the end of this album to the start.\r

Which kicks off with some incredibly icy, enveloping synthesizers. Right at the opening "Everything in Its Right Place" with Thom Yorke sort of beckoning with his very high nasal falsetto, and there are all these weird, creepy robot vocals reversed hanging in the background. It's like I'm being invited into this world of electronic and organic. And this world is also depicted on the cover art of this album as well, we have all these mountaintops what seems like a very natural landscape in one sense, but everything is way too angular and digital to be completely organic. This album to me is about filtering human sadness and human emotions through this synthetic lens. Like on the title track, where we get these very blinky, spacious key, something that sounds like it would have turned up on a Jonny Greenwood soundtrack. And then, over that, these strange, warbling robot vocals, which have this timbre of a drive-through speaker box. I don't think the vocals on this track, and this could be blasphemy, aged all that well over the past 15 years, they sound silly to me at this point. Though, I do think they bring the concept of this track and this album home really well. And I can't deny that the patient beats and very pretty keys on this track did a great job of setting the tone for a lot of the electronic and acoustic fusions that a lot of underground music would deliver to us over the next 10 years. The track is a cool crossroads of man and machine and it glides into the next song nicely.\r

The very heavy and gratifying "The National Anthem" picks the momentum up on the album, it really needed it. I love this track, I love the head bobbing bassline. The drumbeat has a breakbeat style to it Thom Yorke comes through to slice through all of this stuff with this very nasal falsetto. His vocals have some weird feedback, some strange tinny effect on them that reminds me a lot of the robot vocals or the previous track. But it's almost as if Thom Yorke has become a little more human on this next song. So, we're seeing some thematic progression here with how the vocals are presented to us. And then, with the blurting horns and the layers of weeping tones that thicken up the mix as the song progresses, the track it's really overwhelming, powerful, heavy. And then, quickly after this, at very intense high we are brought to a depressing low on the song "How to Disappear Completely". This track is powerfully sad, as many of the songs on this album are.\r
\r
But there are little shimmers of light that poke through the depression of this album in the second half of the record. We have the track "Optimistic", which, despite its very dreary rock instrumentation, there's a lyrical mantra that sticks out, where Thom Yorke is saying "the best you can is good enough, the best you can is good enough". It's almost as if this song is trying to pull itself out of its self-imposed depression and stress. The ascending bassline on this track, as well as the instrumentation that gets thicker as the song moves along, is beautiful, it's another overpowering moment on the album. And there's a little outro guitar line, it's powerful drum fills too toward the finish of this track that I like a lot, that's so brit-rock all the way. This track transitions nicely into the song "In Limbo", which is a very repetitive track, but there certainly reasoning behind that repetition. The swirling guitar arpeggios and the diddling keyboards and the mantra on this track about living in a fantasy, it's like the track has placed us into a dream state right in the midst of this album. And we are woken up right after this track only to find that the world has turned cold and calculated once again, like toward the beginning of the album on the song "Idioteque", where the very robotic and sequenced electronic synthesizers and percussion on this track are matched really nicely with Thom Yorke's vocals, which are some of the most humanized and raw vocals on the entire record.\r
\r
And I love "Motion Picture Soundtrack" as the finish of this record. I love a song that provides a nice, strong ending. And instrumentally, this track feels like a very warm goodbye, which is a nice change of pace, given how powerfully dreary so much of the music was up until this point. But the lyrics of the track reveals a darker side to this little ditty closing the album out, the feelings, the lyrics of this track are fueled by red wine and sleeping pills and sad movies. And the track closes out with Thom Yorke singing that he'll see us in the next life. Is this track some suicide note? Is he saying that he's missing someone he's going to see that person in the afterlife eventually? Is he saying goodbye to this character who he's playing as in this track? Or is he saying goodbye to his audience until the next album? This moment, and a lot of other moments on the record, can be interpreted in a myriad of different ways. But what's important about a lot of the tracks on this record is that the emotions are strong, they're potent. You got to deal with them.\r
\r
There are quite a few moments on this record that are mind-bending and psychedelic, and abstract. But one of the great things about Radiohead, and this has been one of the keys to their success over the years, it doesn't indulge an experimentation to the point where the music is difficult to listen to or appreciate, it's pretty accessible. And while that's going to turn some people off, because Radiohead are not the most adventurous band on the planet, it can be a challenge to make a record that not only try something different, but also appeals to people. And if you're going to appeal to people, that means that there's going to have to be at least a little bit of compromise there in the experimentation process. There is such a thing as restraint and that thing is significant. And "Kid A" puts that significance, as well as a lot of other things on display — the music, the mix, the sound, the instrumentation, the vocals, everything is so nice about LP. And it's a record that is certainly worthy of the praise that it's been getting all of these years. 15 years still going strong, a lot of people still heavily into this record. It's still a genre pusher, it's still a boundary pusher, it's still emotionally intoxicating and a cinematic experience too as far as albums go.\r
