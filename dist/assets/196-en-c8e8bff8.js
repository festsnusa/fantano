const e=`This is the new Agalloch record “Marrow of the Spirit”. These guys are an Oregon outfit, whose music just seems to kind of be a term magnet. Black metal, post rock, folk, doom metal. And in a way, it's true, this new LP and Agalloch's three previous albums are pretty genre-bending, but from my point of view black metal really is the most obvious stylistic influence. For fans of the more classic, more popular sounds in black metal, for the most part they're here, tremolo picking, the really thrashy drum beats, of course the retched vocals. But in a way we're kind of sailing on a very different ship here. Unlike a lot of black metal artists, the recording quality on this thing is very clean. And frontman John Haughm does scream on here, but there are a lot of chilling whispers on here, the sound as if death is kind of breathing down your neck. On “The Watcher's Monolith” there's this really strange eerie old man vocal that kind of comes, in it's very clean, it's played straight, but it just sounds very archaic, I don't know. And on the fourth track “Black Lake Niðstång”, around the seven-minute mark he lets out this really tortured hell that just chilled me to the bone and just got me standing at attention, really fantastic. There's a heavy folk influence on this thing too, which shouldn't be a surprise if you're already a fan of these guys. There are a lot of acoustic guitar strumming chords underneath harmonized guitar solos, lots of of Nordic melodies. And it's not just like this thing switches off between “ooh, it's electric, now it's folk”, this thing is constantly blending the two in different fashions.\r

What I love about Agalloch on this LP is they have an extreme appreciation for dynamics and layers. And in a way it reminds me of how overworked folk elements into their early work. Another band this LP reminds me of, and maybe you guys saw this coming, is Wolves in the Throne Room, also a West Coast metal band, also very black metal influenced, also very ambitious, very atmospheric music. I especially see a lot in common with these guys in terms of song lengths, the tracks here are long as hell, one of the longest being 17 minutes. And one of the most amazing things about this may be, the biggest success of that album, is that Agalloch manages to stay engaging throughout every moment of this LP for me.\r

The track may start with some crickets, maybe some water, just some nature sounds, build into a guitar intro, some grumble, some weird sounds bring in the drums, bring on the vocals, start building it up, layer those guitars out, change up the vocal style, bring it to a climax, boil it down to a drone, another guitar interlude, explode one more time, bow wow, close curtain. These tracks are constantly changing from one idea to another, none of them are stagnant. It's a really progressive record, but it's not flashy, it's very well recorded, but it still manages to maintain a dark atmosphere and some harsh sounds as well.\r

And in terms of gripes, I really don't have many, in comparison to their earlier work, especially their last LP “Ashes Against the Grain”, this album is not as heavy I would say, it doesn't get as pummeling, it doesn't reach that point of high volume, but I feel like that was a conscious choice here. The band has kind of swapped out that overbearing distortion for more sounds and more melody. And it might not have been a bad exchange. If you're a person who likes their music be varied immediate, I could see this thing dragging on for you. And even for some black metal fans, the vocals here might feel maybe a little silly, maybe a little jokey, who knows. But from where I'm standing, this album doesn't feel like that at all. I feel like I'm still yet to understand the album completely, it really unfolds, there's a lot to listen to and there's a lot to uncover with repeated listens, it's one of those albums. And I love music like that.\r
