const e=`Lorde is a New Zealand pop singer and songwriter who hit it huge off of some breakout tracks from her debut EP “The Love Club”, specifically the song “Royals”. When Lorde started turning heads in 2013, she was an exciting new voice in the world of pop music, but the start of her career was very much obviously that of an artist who wasn't planning on becoming an overnight sensation because of the sudden rush of attention, thanks to the track “Royals”, created this instant demand for more music. By the summer, we were hit with “The Tennis Court” EP, and then later in that fall her debut album “Pure Heroine”, which contain highlights from the previous EPs, including “Royals”.\r

And I get that Lorde and her label were doing their best to take advantage of the first year of hype behind her music, but the finished product on “Pure Heroine” was a little rushed. It sounded like a loose collection of tracks that were just too uniform and sound, too skeletal, too basic, too simple to really work as a full record. And despite the fact that I saw quite a bit of potential in her singing, in her voice, in her style, she did come off like a one-trick pony. Which is unfortunate because I thought most of her songs, at least the best songs off of this album, sounded incredibly mature, considering what age she was when she wrote and recorded them. And that it would be great to hear what ever she had to offer several years into the future, when she had improved her skills at songwriting and performing.\r
\r
And here we are, several years into the feature, brand new album, “Melodrama”, which was teased toward with a handful of singles, the biggest of which was easily been the song “Green Light”, which is kind of funny considering that is maybe my least favorite of all the singles on this record — mostly because it feels like kind of a disappointing departure from what made Lorde's music appealing to me at the first place. The stark minimal beat driven instrumentals, the very dramatic vocal performances, essentially finding power in simplicity, which is certainly the case for the introduction of the track, but it does not take long for the song to start introducing these four to the floor kick drums, and these very dance music, friendly piano chords. There's some zany vocal harmonies happening in the background at some points, the track for me, for a Lorde's song it just kind of feels overkill. The lead vocals which are really the selling point to me in Lorde's music just feel like they have less prominence, they're sort of awkward, out of place, especially as this dance kick drum starts going, and immediately Lorde starts writing herself a little out of her vocal range with a low point in her singing.\r

“All these sounds in my mind”\r

The final note there being one that she grazes more than she hits. I'm similarly cold on the song “Sober”, the track seems to build up a lot of tension with these subtle verses, and a very cerebral beat. And this tension is never really quite resolved, even on the hook, even on the groovy beat switch up toward the end of the track. Even with some steamy horns.\r
\r
Where the record really gets going for me is on the “Homemade Dynamite”. It's a track that's really coy and playful, and built upon the strenghts that I think made Lorde's music great to begin with, but now they're elevated with better production, better synth, cool little weird experimental synth embellishments and a very soft breathy, but incredibly sticky hook:\r
\r
“D-d-d-dynamite”.\r

Things also get playfully cute on the song “The Louvre”. The song that features the soft but driving guitars that take us through these endearing lyrics about a young love, figuring itself out. And the lyrics, a little flirty talking about how “we're so great that they'll hang us in the Louvre… in the back, but still the Louvre”. And the hook, the refrain on this thing is actually pretty funny to the “Broadcast the boom boom boom…”. The production at this point gets all kind of distorted and overblown, I kind of like the soundplay here, definitely a bit weirded and off the beaten path than I would expect out of Top 40 Pop Record to be. And the sound change here is huge, it's totally different, it's a big stark contrast from what the verses are doing with the guitar and the vocal melody, but even so, it works. These are kind of experimentation, these are the kinds of surprises that I was looking forward hearing this record, and I'm getting them and love it.\r

The song “Liability” is a passionate and intimate piano ballad that I was deeply impressed with going into this album, and in the context of the tracklist I still think it sounds amazing. The simple piano and vocal combo is great, but it's really about the lyrics on the song which is pretty funny now that I think about it, because if I recall correctly, I was not all that impressed with some of the lyrics on “Pure Heroine”, I went away from that recording hoping and sort of crossing my fingers that Lorde would progress further on that record, that she would mature a little lyrically, and get a bit more adventurous, a bit more intimate, a bit more detailed in what she's singing about — and that's definitely the case, especially on this song, where she's singing about sort of the position that her fame puts her in making her a difficult lover, a difficult friend. Because, you know, sort of being in that limelight once, people in your life, family, whoever it be, is also in that limelight with you, just by nature of being with you, being connected to you, by blood or by love, you become sort of liability and it sort of makes life kind of weird. As she says “people pull back, they make other plans”, it's a really interesting take on the way that fame can impact a relationship, an interesting angle not only for her, but for pop music in general.\r
\r
I'm equally wowed by the recreation of the rush of the memories that hit you when you think about an older relationship that, you know, have a lot of sentimental feelings about on the track “Supercut”. There's something kind anthemic 80's arena pop, arena rock about the way the song is built up that I like a lot. It's awesome to sort of hear this style of music ring so true in Lorde's music, not only because I think she does adjust this, but it's kind of “U-huh” moment for me, like “of course like this sort of music, of course this sound would be such a huge inspiration to not only what you do on this record, but earlier on your career too”.\r
\r
Lorde seems to be lamenting the death of the same relationship on the track “Writer in the Dark” where what really makes this track stand out for me is that there is a sudden vocal change on this track where she goes into her upper register and hits this inflection that has a very Kate Bush sort tone to it. There's some powerful strings here, some sad simple piano chords, and I like the passion in her voice, I love sort of how cracked, sad and depressing it sounds. And what's even funnier as the song is about how the guy who she used to be with, I bet he's regretting the fact that he kissed a writer, kissed a songwriter, kissed an artist, a creator, because “now I'm writing all these songs about him”. And now everybody's hearing all these songs and our relationship is kind of being put on blast. Certainly more self-aware than Taylor Swift, who will just continually pump out song about shattered relationships like she's a human assembly line. But as long as Lorde is being a little self aware about this, I wish she kind of took it another step further, because in the Internet age, in the Information Age, other artists rapping or singing about their ex's can be kind of odd because the moment that one of them does instantaneously loads of gossip sites, troll the Internet, do their research and sometimes they find out who these people are and post articles about them which in a way can be kind of embarrasing or abusive, even if relationship didn't kind of end on bad terms.\r
\r
I love the very heavy and intoxicating “Hard Feelings”, which features an odd instrumental with a bridge that has all these shrill loud metallic tones, sort of battling it out over the instrumental that I feel like I'm listening to poltergeist yell at each other. I should probably stress here, this is a really odd thing to happen on such a big pop record, while there are some songs where Lorde is obviously making some Top 40 concessions, there are quite a few tracks here still, where weird stuff like this occurs. And not only does it sound really interesting, it sounds beautiful and it sounds exciting. I'm so happy to hear that Lorde is continuing to take musical and sonic risks in her music, while still delivering an album that overall is pretty accessible.\r
\r
Now there are a few reprises on the album where she references back to previous tracks, the song “Sober II”, as well “Liability (Reprise)” toward the end of the album. Which is something that I like on this record, it says to me that Lorde is thinking of this entire album as a continually flowing as a linear experience, not simply just a collection of tracks. Even when I think of some of the weird trap percussion on the song “Sober II” is kind of off. However, the closer “Perfect Places” might be my least favorite song on the entire record. To me it seems like this track is just trying way too hard to define a generation as it were by making partying sounds superdeep and serious. As well as trying to deliver this huge, just mountainous, but also very empty oversized chorus that invites everyone into not only sing but to think of themselves and everyone else listening to this song, and everyone else is a part of this millenial generation on just one big collective where we love each other. Maybe I'm taking that a littl too far, but the instrumentation is kind of overkill, especially for a tune that isn't really that significant in Lorde's canon and the beat is just a deja vu of another beat out of “Pure heroine”. Maybe I'm taking it a little too fr, but the song really does epitomize the title of the album “Melodrama”, and not in the best way.\r
\r
However, despite the weak moments at the very start and in the very end of the record, I think this is a really solid pop album. Certainly, a sign of maturity and growth past her sudden appearance in the spotlight several years ago. Lorde seems really be growing into her sound, growing into her voice, growing into her style and expanding upon it too. And at this point based on what I've heard on this record, it sounds like she has many more solid records to come.\r
