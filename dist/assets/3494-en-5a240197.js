const e=`This is the latest full-length LP from electronic music producer and songwriter Porter Robinson. Seven years after the release of his beloved debut “Worlds”, an album that admittedly when it first dropped I was not into it. It did not get a positive review, and I still get a lot of crap for that review to this day. And I can't really say I've warmed up to the album all that much since. I mean, I get it's one of the more respected records of the 2010s when it comes to electropop and EDM aesthetics, but I just don't care for how those sounds come together on this particular LP. The overly idyllic and sunny group vocals combined with how overpowering artificial and fantastical the instrumentation comes across, I just don't really care for the flavor of this record. I could say more, but i'm not here to rile up anybody's “Worlds” review related PTSD. Besides, I was actually looking forward to this new record not just because I thought all the teasers were legitimately great, but it's also been a pretty long time since “Worlds” dropped at this point. And I know, since the release of this LP, Robinson has had his hands in other things but it's still a very large gap between records. So I figured, something new and exciting has to have been cooking up in that time. Especially since much of the EDM landscape Robinson was pulling inspiration from at that point has changed radically since then.\r

Now, I don't know, this might be weird to think for some Robinson fans, but personally I see “Nurture” here as being leaps and bounds better than “Worlds”. And this is despite both projects scratching similarly escapist itches. As “Nurture” is a fairly feel good, blissful, shimmering project. But the sound palettes Robinson employs this time around are a lot more nuanced, gauzy, less overpowering and more enveloping. There is a softer and slightly more organic approach on the vocals too, which I greatly appreciate, which I find to be way more listenable than a lot of the tacky and faux epic singing performances strewn about “Worlds”. And while japanese pop and media soundtracks have served as an inspiration in Robinson's stuff for a while, it seems to bleed through even harder here, especially in the piano work that pops up occasionally. Folk music actually takes center stage on a few tracks too, blending in perfectly with the generally joyous and dreamy vibes of this record.\r

“Nurture” is a consistent project, but still one with a lot of versatility in its track list, a lot of highlights too. One of the first songs on the record, this may be a stretch for some people, but I really feel like this is the “One More Time” [Daft Punk] of the album. It's just that euphoric dance anthem with a driving beat super addictive ear worm chorus, setting an epic and otherworldly tone for the record. Now, of course, Robinson pulls these core parallels off with a radically different set of sounds and aesthetics. There, I think also is a pretty strong difference in who this album is meant to appeal to at the time it is being released. Maybe a societally neglected generation of terminally online kids, using anime and music to soften the blow of their pandemic ravaged reality.\r

Now, following this track is the equally sunny “Get Your Wish”. The crisp drums and digitized bird sounds underscore some really cheery synthesizers that feel like the soundtrack to a japanese RPG from the 90s. All of these elements building to some amazingly heavy dance beats around the midpoint. I also love the cute, but alien manipulations on the lead vocals from this track and many others on this LP too, they add to the record's feelings of immersion that all this music just everything here is coming from a different place, a different dimension.\r
\r
“Wind Tempos” is an interesting change of pace for the first leg of the record. It's the longest song on this project at six minutes. And not because the track undergoes some long winding epic progression or build or something. No, the whole first leg of the track is taken up by this part minimal, part glitch piano passage, eventually giving way to this delicate solo piano piece that is so beautiful, it's difficult to describe. The digitally mangled vocals that pop in on top of these pianos on the back end are strangely beautiful and moving, it's like listening to some kind of artificial intelligence have a religious experience.\r
\r
The track “Musician” is another enjoyable one here for me. It's a jittery pop number that sounds like a combination of the quaintness of The Postal Service, some very pillowy shoegaze sonics and the collective intuition of like 12 bedroom producers. “do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do” is a very cute semi-acoustic number. I love the return of the nature sounds on this track, as well as the gently pulsating beats. All of which undergo these very speedy edge of your seat progressions, this track to me feels like what living in Animal Crossing must be like. The very euphoric and hazy electronic pop continues on to the song “Mother”, which lyrically gives away one of the most beautiful and heartfelt sentiments of the entire record. But the following “Dullscythe” does begin the start of a miniature dip on “Nurture” for me. Keep in mind, so far I do love the crossroads of glitch and piano music on this record, but here it goes a little awry. The various passages of this track separately are fine, but the way they connect or don't connect creates a pretty jarring four minutes that doesn't really go much of anywhere in terms of like momentum or direction.\r
\r
Meanwhile, the pacing on the track “Sweet Time” for me did leave a little bit to be desired at its core, the track feels like one of those slow burning, pumping dramatic 80s anthems, but ultimately it wasn't pushed far enough in the end. Thankfully, the throttling dance beats pick the pace up once again on “Something Comforting”. Then, “Blossom” is a gorgeous acoustic number. The track “Unfold” sees a crossover with totally enormous extinct dinosaurs, the extra vocal layers help bring the record to a grand finish. Then, “Trying to Feel Alive” felt to me almost like a credits roll moment for the record.\r
\r
But seriously, what an enchanting record. You know, it's not often I want to use language like “spellbound”, because it seems like, you know, really pretentious and shit, but I did really feel spellbound by numerous portions of this thing. It's just so pretty and I mean it really feels like the cover, it feels like laying in just a sunny field of sweet smelling digital grass. You know, it's not a perfect record by any means, there were a few tracks that I was a little mild on in terms of reaction, but in some respects to take it back to the first comparison I've made earlier in the review, I feel like this is like the “Discovery” [by Daft Punk] of this generation — it's very much an electronic music record that runs conceptual, cinematic, very holistic in its presentation of songs and aesthetics, the flow of the record too. And I don't know, I mean, I feel like that's really the highest compliment I could give it. Like regardless of score or descriptions, or anything like that. For some reason I just couldn't get that comparison or similarity out of my head. And of course, I mean that in the most flattering way possible. And it feels weird to make it because I'm sure some people are going to listen to this record based on that comparison and think “this sounds nothing like “Discovery”, sounds nothing like Daft Punk”. And yeah, you're right to observe that aesthetically, that there isn't a whole lot of overlap. But again, both records to me felt very grandiose, cinematic, very holistic and I came away from both with just a positive, glowing, inspired feeling. Which I hope if you listen to this, you get from it as well.\r
