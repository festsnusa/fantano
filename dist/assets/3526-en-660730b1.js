const e=`This is the latest full-length album of singer and songwriter and author Michelle Zauner, aka Japanese Breakfast, whose versatile brand of dreamy lustrous pop has been gaining more and more attention with each release. Jubilee is easily the biggest splash she's made so far and it's not hard to see why. As there's so many stunning and alluring instrumental palettes across this tight 10 song tracklist, which feels almost far removed from the guitar driven sounds and 90s influences on Michelle's last full-length LP. Which I think is a move for the better as evidenced in the magical opener “Paprika” — the marching snares, the grand horn sections with a foreign flare, the soaring Kate Bush-ian lead vocals. Also good, and not only are the melodies enchanting on this track, but Michelle showcases her wit as a lyricist and a poet too with evocative contrasts of loneliness with also feeling like you're at the center of attention. The lyrics reads like a statement of intent and a wonderful description of, I guess, what it's like to be a successful artist in a way.\r

The following track “Be Sweet” is a dark groovy number with a slick 80s veneer on it. It's like a classic piece of synth pop combined with the post disco eccentrics of Yoko Ono's “Walking on Thin Ice”, with starry choruses and verses that get to the heart of love, forgiveness and making things right when you've wronged. What's not to love?\r
\r
Meanwhile, “Kokomo” is a sunny lazy acoustic cut that brings in some beautiful string layers. It's a blissful and well-arranged piece of vocal pop that sounds like it's straight out of the 60s, but it is also slightly subversive in the way that you know the musician has heard their fair share of Velvet Underground & Nico. The lyrics on this one are absolutely lovesick too, but the sincerity and word choices that Michelle brings to the table really sell it.\r

“Slide Tackle” feels almost like one of the groovier cuts from Michelle's last record. Outside of the faint horns calling away in the background, it doesn't really feel too much like a step forward, while we may be hearing more layers on this track, the verses meander a bit, the transition into the chorus isn't that strong, and a lot of the guitar embellishments on the second half are a little bit sloppy or just distract away from the vibe more than it enhances it.\r
\r
Now, this track leads into kind of a low-key midpoint for the LP. There's the semi-ambient “Posing in Bondage”, where Michelle could be heard singing dramatically over swelling synthetic tones, spacious fragmented beats. I love the feelings coming through on this track, some of the instrumental variations in the second half, but the deeply pitched chorus vocals that accompany her leads on the chorus, I think the song could have done without, they kind of swallow her voice a little bit.\r
\r
But then, on to my least favorite track on the record, which has to be “Sit”, this one goes in more of a shoegaze direction, which considering Michelle's bag catalog should be a layup, it's a familiar territory. But trying to fuse these walls of distortion and driving beats with what sounds like reverb heavy baroque pop, it led to some awkward results. There's just a lot of layers, a lot of effects on this one and much of it in my opinion is just clashing.\r
\r
Thankfully, the LP does come to a somewhat strong final leg. There is the hard-hitting “Savage Good Boy”, which is a gender role bending tune of devotion. Singing about someone you want to come home to and, I guess, live a domesticated life with, make a lot of money , also have a pension in six condos. It gets kind of satirical, especially toward the end where things get like very apocalyptic, very end of the world, but the love, the message is there.\r
\r
Then, the lyrical tone really shifts on the track “In Hell”, which is lyrically one of my favorite tracks here. Just a harrowing song about anticipating the death of a loved one, which you might not know given just how easygoing the vocals and the instrumental generally feel. The song sounding like some very low-key indie rock with some cute synth layers here and there. But Michelle's words on this track reveal a much more traumatic story, which I believe may call back to her mother passing of cancer years ago.\r
\r
“Tactics” is yet another gorgeous ballad on this thing — strong hook, elegant strings, good structure, heart-wrenching lyrics about self-preservation and distancing yourself from a love. The thing cuts like a Bright Eyes' song, but has a much more pillowy presentation. But yeah, another great song on this thing, Michelle just keeps churning them out like it's nothing.\r
\r
But then there's the closing cut “Posing For Cars”, which starts off well enough as an acoustic ballad, but then tries to build off from there into a grand finale, which doesn't go over as smoothly as I had hoped. The deafening fuzzy guitar solo certainly feels out of place, the soloing isn't as smooth as it could have been.\r
\r
That being said though, this is a very good album. The hype is real, even if I'm not as crazy about this thing as some critics have been. Great songs, great lyrics, great vocals, a lot of my issues with this LP boil mostly down to the extra instrumentation, Michelle's bringing into the fold, which again doesn't go over well all the time. But maybe whatever kinks I'm hearing here can be worked out on a future LP.\r
