const e=`This is the brand new LP from legendary Chicago rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, designer, former presidential candidate, Kanye West. Not gonna overdue the intro on this thing, as I think Kanye West has a reputation that precedes him at this point. Most people have their own perception of him, including me — I'm not seeking the change in that review. But I do have some opinions about his new record here, which have a pretty dramatic lead up. There was a sudden announcement, then followed one release date pushed back after another. There was a series of theatrical events over which the record's seem to kind of taken shape in terms of its songs, its production, its features. It kind of reminded me of the hectic way in which “The Life Of Pablo” rolled out originally, but maybe this time it felt longer. And God, help me if this album features and mixes are like changing over the next six months. The whole roll out suddenly turned adversarial as Kanye and Drake struck up beaf in the middle of it too. Seemed like for a moment, they might drop their records on the same day. Then of course, things got controversial at the final listening event, which featured DaBaby off of his recent live comments, and Marilyn Manson, who's also fresh off from really daming, grooming abuse allegations.\r
\r
Now, I hate to have a detour this whole review to go into this and my thoughts on it, but I have to. As annoying as it can be, I'm usually all for Kanye playing as provocateur, but not when abuse victims and the LGBTQ community are collateral damage. In my opinion, that whack is fuck. Now, it still wouldn't be an excuse, but it would be one thing if he felt like their inclusion played in the some vital message to the record, because many fans were theorizing they may have something to do with forgiveness, and sin and cancel culture. But if that was all the intent ultimatelly, there was no real follow through on that message. Manson and DaBaby only ended up being relegated to alternate version on the tracks on the end of the record. If they were central to some kind of idea Kanye wanted fans to take away from Donda, I don't think they would be used as live show props, headliners, and end up in bonus material.\r
\r
Now, if you're familiar with Kanye's back history, you know he's not beyond cringe inducing promotional stunts and tacky moves. And easily this was one of his tackiest and most transparent. And I hope this is the last time I have to say that. So, we're finally on the other side of this wall of flames, with the album. The album is out, the album is here. And of course it's huge, it's long, it's a massive project, which I ultimately don't see as a bad thing, because after “Jesus is King” and some of Kanye's very public mental health struggles, I was worried we wouldn't get another from him over the half and hour for a while. And I'm actually shocked that “Donda” is came out sounding as cohesive as it does, because between the roll out, the stuff with Drake, his separation from Kim Kardashian — there's been a lot to Kanye off of his balance.\r
\r
But that being said, this record is not without its flaws. Kanye clearly lacked the wisdom to edit out or shorten some of the more inconsistent or indulgent moments here. I will not go as far as to say that this record is bloated as some people have. But the extended outro on “God Breathed” just seemed kind of unneccesary, even having listen to it multiple times. Baby's came completely derails of what otherwise be a pretty great highlight on this record, delivering the verse that can't quite seem to get started or find any sense of direction, sometimes he even has difficulties delivering a coherent thought.\r
\r
Then, the track “Junya” runs sort of like a Playboy Carti's rip-off — it's very repetitive, distorted beats, overuse of adlibs — and of course, Carti's on this track as well. Personally, I don't mind Kanye's trying this sound out, but I think he's kind of already got away with creatively hijacking it on the track “Off The Frid” to a degree. Playboy Carti is on that track too and this song is a killer from front to back. I think this was kind of an instance, where he should have quite while he was ahead and just moved on to one of the many of the great tracks that are already on the record.\r
\r
Now, I like the track “Believe what I say” a lot. It's a very warm, luscious, fun and catchy piece of hip house with a great Lauryn Hill flip on it. But the more I listen to it, the more the song feels completely out of line with the record's core vibes and aesthetics. Maybe in the way that is the point, because overall this does feel like a very cold and desolate album. This is the only moments of fun on this LP, I think. And Lauryn's voice is one of the few moments of the strong female presence as well. But still, I can't shake the feeling that the song runs like a tea-lop afterthought and just sticks out like a sort of thumb and not in the best way.\r
\r
There's also “Remote Control” which I think at least for me wins the award for worst chorus on the entire record. The hook lyrics and melody from Kanye are so awkward, are so thrown together. I'm not just not on this one, even a decent Young Thug's verse do not save it. Shout out to videogame “Donkey Kong” for influencing one of the weirdest anomalist to ever crop out on the Kanye album at the very end of the song though.\r
\r
Then, what is the track “New Again”? I mean, I love the intro to this track, I kind of getting a “Graduation” vibe off of it, but overall to me this feels like a piece of Christian EDM with Chris Brown. Yes, Chris Brown is on this track, reminder that the concerns Marilyn Manson stirred up with his inclusion on this record. Also, still applied to Chris Brown who continues to get features in industry wide at this moment.\r
\r
Then, we also have “Tell The Vision”, which is in my opinion just does not need to be. We know most of Kanye's album aren't just an artistic statement or a singular vision, but also a reflection a hip-hop's current landscape. He turns to pull a lot of the newer talent that's out there right now. So with that, I appreciate Kanye's wanting to work with some kind of like Pop Smoke's tribute into this record at some point. But I feel like this is not it, not only do the swear edits in the Pop Smoke's vocal and these interludes sound kind of awkward, but the ghostly manipulations of his voice just come off really odd and the whole intstrumental doesn't really bringing much of a vibe or a groove, even none of it flows from or into the tracks that surrounded. Again, as much as I think this track has it's heart in the right place, it comes out really thrown together.\r
\r
My biggest complain on the record past this point probably lies with the song “Pure Souls”, which does features from Shenseea, as well as Roddy Ricch. The organ chords on this track are great, the instrumental is generally impressive, but at the midpoint I'm just not into the Kanye's voice. I think it's his least interesting verse on the entire record. It's a bit of a drag, he doesn't seem to know how to end it at one point. He kinda starts off going into his past, retail addiction, goes into some singing passages from there. And intensional or not, I'm just not crazy about the audible crackling due to the mastering on this track on the back end.\r
\r
When it comes to this record, I have complains, I really do. But, I also have a lot of praise for this project as well. Yeah, it's kind of a mess, but I also it leads beyonf “Jesus is King” and it's kind of what I wanted out of that record to begin with. As I said in my review of that album, it didn't so much feel like an expression of Kanye's faith, as much as it felt like an extension of the mental health struggles that Kanye was having on his record just before that, but with a religious angle. But “Donda” by comparison runs like a much thorough and sincere vision of praise. However, with that don't expect Kanye's religious conviction to become any clearer this time around. Because once again Ye's believes continue to sound super specific to him. And as someone who's not particularly religious, I guess this does not really matter much to me. Still, it does not seem like Kanye's guided by some collectively understood word of god. More like he's gonna do whatever he feels like doing. And then come up with some kind of religious rationalisation after the fact.\r
\r
Now, while it may be easy to objectively poke holes in Kanye's faith, objectivity and personal believe in a higher power don't mix usually any way. And I argued that passion he portrayes for his faith is still pretty compelling. In that way, “Donda” is kind of succeed as a spiritual statement. With the occasional tributes to his mother and illusions to his recent family struggles. Because in its best moments “Donda” has a lot of topical focus, as well as songs and instrumentals that features a very stark and spacy presentation. There may be a lot of talk about god on this record, but it doesn't feel like a godly, warm, heavenly experience. A lot of this LP, to be honest, feels like Kanye's begging to be released from this purgatorial state, which I think is hinted at instrumentally and aesthetically in numerous ways. Like the very stiff and drumless progression of “Jail”, or the industrial throbbing beats and distorted vocal samples on the song “God Breathed”, which are kind of “Yeezus”-esque. There's the rudimentary rhythms, chilling atmosphere and sun burnt gospel choir hits on “Hurricane”.\r
\r
The more I listen to my favorite part of this LP, the more I feel like I'm experiencing some other wordly sounds. It's simple, it's bold, it feels like something Kanye would do, but it kind of warped and distorted in a surreal way. Now, as I was saying earlier, “Donda” may not be the most consistent record under the sun, but it does kind of make up for that with a forty day, forty night highlights, features that focus on the overall concept at hand and some verses from Kanye that make him sound like he's sort of his old self again.\r
\r
As I was saying, there are some great features on this LP, they're really at the moment of this LP. Jay Z's on “Jail” — I love his wordplay on this cut, he's charismatic from end to end. And the way he kind of pushed the Kanye a little bit with that red capline as further he's gonna go for sure. Then, there was “Fivio Foreign” on “Off The Grid”, which I have sort of being into this guy's music up until this point, like he's been hiding his fucking power level — he went at length on this song and just had some one of the best bars, some of the smartest lyrics, some of the most emotionally compelling imagery on the entire record and he goes. Plus, the drill style beat change happened underneath him too. The Weeknd's vocals on “Hurricane” are great, Lil Baby on that track continues the creative streak he's been on as of late, he's really coming into his own, and it's great. Vory and Lil Durk, both give really personal and moving musical performances on “Jonah”. Then, Kanye, Cudi and Don Toliver all layer up into pure vocal bliss on the song “Moon”. Even Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine back up the record godly themes on “Keep my Spirit Alive”. Jay Electronica delivers one of his best features in a while on “Jesus Lord”.\r
\r
So yes, most of the features on this record are impressive, they add so much to the overall experience. But the songs are so good too. “Off the Grid” is easliy one of Kanye's most merciless and progressive bangers in a while. It's damn futuristic with dystopian vibes, psychedelic undertones as well as this drill beat as I mentioned earlier. Creatively structured, but insanely catchy in any way. And the same goes to the song “Jail”, which is anthemic, I love its some burnt guitars, Kanye's vocals, Jay Z' inclusion again. The song “Heaven and Hell” has a kind of linear progression too with the instrumental ending off with these very distorted buzzy synthesizers and totally unhinged “Kids See Ghosts” adlib. The gorgeous melodies and pristine atmopshere surrounding the song “Moon” make that one a stunner. And talking about stunning, the song “Come to Life”, which features all of these very fast, propulsive, minimalist piano layers. The way the track launches on port feels like experiencing the rapture. And then there's a chilly, airy “No Child Left Behind” is sort of like the aftermath, the calm after the storm. Like in between these tracks, I do just wanna comment saying like Kanye's clearly been working on singing at least a little bit of late, there are moments where his vocals can be a little bit off, like on the “Pure Souls”, but like when he's on it's one of the best singing he's ever done on the entire record.\r
\r
I think “Donda” contains one of the best rapping and writing in a while too. Storytelling on “Jesus Lord” is certainly worthy a higher praise. As Kanye weaves in reflections on drugs, addiction, abortion, being desperate to connect with his mother again. Giving the content, I think this is one of the most telling personally verses from Kanye in a while and in regards of his mother's pass I think this is like, in music anyway, the most has been processed in front of us. Then “Heaven and Hell” has this manic “Yeezus” type energy to it, vocally and emotionally he just sounds revamped. The bars on “Jonah” make for a really interesting narrative in a record, because there is a posturing, there's a lot of aggression, there's a lot of pushing people away, but also feelings of isolation too, which I think makes sense for Kanye to reflect on, because all of the negative reaction, his behavior as of late has been eliciting from his loved ones and close friends. His rapping on “Hurricane” has that charged up, redemptive energy to it that I feel like calls back to “My Beautifu Dark Twisted Fantasy”, it's like Kanye once again knows he put out a record that disappointed the fans, and a result of that he really wants to come back with a vengeance and to prove people are wrong. And once again, his raw energy on “Off the Grid” proves that just something about Kanye that snaps so hard even at this age to where he can bring too young guys on the track and like totally keep up that energy level with them and not sound like a guy in his freaking 40s.\r
\r
Now, of course there are some corny Kanye bars in the mix here and there, but honestly with each Kanye project I kind of expect these bars to happen and at this point it's really a matter whether or not they are derailing a record overall. On “Jesus is King” I think it was especially the case, considering that in my opinion a lot of the material on that LP was weak. With the material on “Donda” being so much stronger, I don't think that is a concern.\r
\r
Overall, “Donda”, I think it's a good record, I think it's a good big flawed, godly record with Kanye's best material in a long time. And while it's not a perfect LP, it's not my favorite LP, I am enthusiastic to see Kanye at least reach a point of creative stability and focus once again. And I'm also hoping this leads to at least to some semblance of personal focus and stability for my own sanity when it comes to the next album roll out at some point.\r
