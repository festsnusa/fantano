const e=`This is the new remix album from one of pop's biggest icons and strongest voices, Lady Gaga, with well over a decade of hits and outlandish outfits under her belt right now, one may expect her at this time, maybe be slowing down creatively. But no, actually in my opinion the “Chromatica” era has shown to be just as wild and uncompromising as many of her albums roll out so far. And I also think that the record “Chromatica” was a pretty quality too, with numerous tracks that celebrated more classic forms of house and dance pop. Now, the record came out, it was good, I think Gaga could have easily left it there and moved on. But instead, now we have a remix album, and this remix album could have easily been something that Gaga played relatively straight with a series of producers or singers that handed in really accessible EDM revision on the tracks of the record. But no, “Dawn of Chromatica” is actually one of the riskiest, one of the adventerous and insane remix project to drop from any artist at any Gaga's level. As she really leaned into growing community of hyperpop producers, as well as queer leaning pop artists.\r

Now, with this being said, this thing is still a remix album so far. Of course, it does suffer some of the same issues that a lot of remix albums do, not every remix hits, and of course the respective artistic visions of each artists on this project — they don't always line up. But Gaga giving everyone involved on this thing, a lot of creative freedom has led to some real highlights. Like Arca's version of “Rain on me” with Ariana Grande is almost like an anti-remix or sorts. The whole thing feels like I'm being edged musically for several long lasting minutes. Rather than delivering hard drop, the further the song goes along, it gets more direct and spacy. Giving Arca abstract and experimental pedigree, I guess this is something I should have seen it coming. But yeah, even though this one is a little left field, I feel the more I listen to it, the more I sort of understand what's going for, the more I appreciate it and the more that I hear it's easily one of the most texturally and sonically creative remixes here. Though, it's may be more for headphones than it is the dancefloor.\r

Then, with the track “Fun Tonight” Pabllo Vitar reinvent this one with almost a tachano flare, completed with accordeon and everything. And it's so good, I feel like this version really enhances the vocal melody of the track and feels almost romantic by comparison. And it comes off so natural and organic. If I've heard this first, I would be convinced it was an original, not a remix at all.\r
\r
With “911”, Charli XCX and AG Cook are tared up in a way that I appreciate because it's not like so obviously pandoring to hyperpop fans that maybe expecting them to sound in a very specific way on this song. There is a sparkling intro on this track, a lot of driving, throbbing, eerie techno beats. A surprising saxophone sounds too that brings us to this heavy rhythmic odyssey. Then, the whole thing is kind of turns into a glossy trap ballad, with Gaga and Charli's vocals are kind of swapping in and out here and there, each sounding great, it's a multi-faced remix that has a lot of character to it.\r
\r
Then, “Plastic Doll” with Ashnikko. I'm not crazy about this one, but I like about it is that it's corky and futuristic pop and rap fusion that very much fits her style, giving the sentiment of this song a message of it. I feel like this track was right up out of Ashnikko's discography.\r
\r
Then, this version of “Sour Candy” from Shygirl and Mura Masa is not nearly as bright or lifeful as original, and that's kind of what I like about it. There's something a lot more serious and sinister about the approach taken on this remix. Especially thanks to the cerebral dance beats pushing away in the background and Shygirl's very low-key and moody vocal delivery.\r
\r
The Dorian remix is one that I was mostly looking forward to it on this project. They absolutely killed it here with some heavy chugging metal guitars that kind of calls back to the “My Agenda” project, but totally work here too. It's a crazy mix of heavy metal music and dance that I hope the Gaga's fans are ready for.\r
\r
Then, the “Sine From Above” with Elton John, the remix of this track with Chester Lockhart, Moodkiller and Lil Texas doing some hard style on the back end — this is one of the most insane things I think I've ever heard. It's a track that really disorienting, but fun. One that I had to listen to multiple times to really kind of get a grasp of it. Because Mood Killer is throwing so much add in the mix at once and always changing things up aesthetically, throwing in some wild transitions. There are so much and tongue-and-cheek edits on this track too, from some of the glitchy skips and Elton John's voice, to the line where Elton and Gaga are singing about silence, but there's silence instead of the word. The song has being titled a “Sine From Above”, there is even a quick fraction of the second word where we're hit with the sine wave. I think, for some people this version of this track may be a little much, but considering this wasn't necessarily one of my favs from the original “Chromatica” record, I might enjoy this version just a bit more.\r
\r
Then, the Jimmy Edgar's remix of “Babylon” is great too. A more synthetic and smooth presentation of the track, while still maintaining its anthemic songwriting and structure, and I think Bree Runway was a fantastic addition to the song too.\r
\r
So yeah, there were great cuts all over this thing too. I do have some reservations about a few tracks. The second remix of “Babylon” — I thought it was kind of unneccessary, there aren't really creative liberties taken with the opening remix either. The DOSS remix of “Enigma” I thought was easily the weakest on the project, some of the vocal samples on this thing don't really lined up all that well, and stylistically I thought this wasn't as nearly as bald as the bulk of the material here too. I wish the “Free Woman” remix went further honestly, I think Rina did a great job vocally on this version of the track, which is no surprise considering how great that song she did with Elton came out, but instrumentally I feel like I'm mostly listening to the same song, but a more cluttered, I guess, version that I don't think really enhances the experience necessarily.\r
\r
But again, with all that being said, I thought “Dawn of Chromatica” was a really fun new way to enjoy this Gaga record. Loved that she's platforming some artists who absolutely deserve it, from people like Planningtorock, who have been at this for a while with some of the new outbreakers out there. And I hope if you guys listen to it, don't expect every track to jell with you, don't expect that every track would blow you away, but some cuts on here are fantastic, I hope you'll find it exciting and creative as I do.\r
