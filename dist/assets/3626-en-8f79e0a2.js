const e=`This is the second full-length lp of Sarah Tudzin's illuminati hotties. I first became acquainted with Sarah's music through last year's FREE I.H. mixtape “This Is Not the One You've Been Waiting For”. which through its title still set my expectations high, i mean after all, what if it was the one i was waiting for. I couldn't tell if the project was bringing together elements of indie rock, noise pop, pop punk and riot girl as a result of like dutiful study or chaotic genre blending. Either way it resulted in a pretty perfect balance of all of these sounds. But ultimately, it was Sarah's incredible wit and irreverent attitude that left an impression on me. There were some points where I wanted more from the songwriting or felt like the production fell a little flat even for something with a DIY flair. But the record still did what it needed to do in terms of bringing more attention to Sarah's music than it ever had before and making her an indie artist to watch for the next year or so. Which makes this new album here kind of a make-or-break moment with so many people listening and watching, it better be your best project yet.\r

And it in fact is and not that I was worried going into it, I mean, we pretty much got half the record in teasers and they were all great to some degree. And “MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA”, the first single from the LP — the wildly eccentric lead vocals and sour post punk guitars signaled toward a record that was going to be more colorful and maybe more uncompromising. Especially with these lyrics that read like an aggressively blended smoothie of absurdities, occasionally throwing out criticisms of commercialism in the DNC. It's a great track and somehow there's nothing else on the record that sounds like it and I find that kind of refreshing. Because I think versatility is the name of the game on “let me do one more”. But most of the tracks here still come back to some basic musical truths of indie rock and pop punk.\r

The song “Pool Hopping” is as fun and sweet as the melty scoop of ice cream mentioned in the lyrics. The track is peppered with groovy rhythms, tight vocal harmonies, a super infectious hook as well:\r

But those driving rhythm guitars and kind of snotty lead vocals are really what keeps the fire burning. There's an unspeakably dark and kind of grungy tension that goes over very well on the song “Knead”. And “Threatening Each Other re: Capitalism” is an incredible slow burner that reads like a crossroads between abject depression and satirical consumerism. The slow and dramatic guitars and drums set the stage for some very shy vocal melodies and when that rush of of heavy guitars hit. I don't really know what's more devastating, the sound of the song or the capitalist schemes that are hidden away in Sarah's lyrics:\r

They say they'll cut your fruit in half\r
It saves you sweat, but your haul rots fast\r
Now, twice a weekm you're hauling back.\r
Then, the song “u v v p”, I'm almost mad at this one because if there's anything I hated about indie rock and pop of the 2010s, it was its embrace of beach and beach rock aesthetics. And that's pretty much what this one does. Albeit, it's very ironic about the whole thing and I do appreciate that. Plus, I like the way that Sarah with her writing plays with these concepts of romance, some of the musical transitions throughout the song are really creative and that spoken word outro from Buck Meek is a hilariously campy. So even if it's kind of rooted in a trend I don't care for, there is a lot of creativity to it that I can't deny.\r
\r
Then, we have the even more amazing “Joni: LA's No. 1 Health Goth”, which is about this Joni character that I guess for Sarah in this song is like this object of envy. Over this completely wild instrumental she's described as a punk babe — she's sexy, smart, she's in bands, she's cutting edge, she's a true rebel that doesn't take shit from anybody. But overall, the track's got a lot of energy, a lot of character, it's very catchy, it's got a lot of interesting and funny descriptions in the lyrics. Plus, the brutally nasty vocal tone is just classic punk all the way. The rockin' cheap shoes goes over without hitch too.\r
\r
Once I finished with the record, it was really some of the more low-key moments that for me were hit or miss. I liked the idea of these tracks being included in concept, because they do bring the record some necessary variety. But “Protector” for example, I found to be a little bland especially in the first leg. Again, interesting that Sarah threw in a song that was essentially a slow paced, somewhat droney piece of ambient pop with a decent build toward the end. But it just came off a little too one-dimensional sadly.\r
\r
The song “Kickflip” as well brought a nice change of pace aesthetically. The track's kind of fun in that it's difficult to define, it feels like I'm listening to a punked out piece of psych country. But I still found the songwriting on this one to be partially a dud as the vocal melodies were super repetitive and tedious. There's not too much to speak of in terms of progression either.\r
\r
But with all that being said, I still think the closing track “Growth” goes over well, even with it being the most choked up, quiet and indirect sonically track on the entire LP, but it's absolutely soul crushing on the lyrical front. On this one single song Sarah kind of outsays all of the professionally depressed indie stars out there, with this dejected guitar strumming and lyrics about feeling used, losing her dog and essentially succumbing to the emotional numbness and lack of expectations that often come with adulthood.\r
\r
Overall, “let me do one more”, I'll say is kind of scatter shot and not every song is fantastic. But it's still loaded with bangers. It's got a lot of personality, snappy songwriting, colorful and versatile rock production too. Yes, I'll say this was the one that i was waiting for.\r
