const e=`This is a brand new record from music collective deaths dynamic shroud. Members — Keith Rankin, James Webster and Tech Honors — have been making waves in vaporwave for years now, really becoming community favorites after the release of 2015's “I'll Try Living Like This”. And they've stayed really active since then, I would say even more so the case now since they began this little mixtape club. Many artists and fans are bending to the whims of the streaming industry these days, but some are taking the initiative to work outside of that framework entirely. Dds' approach, at least in this instance, is to do a series of exclusive projects tapes, one a month in fact, which can be accessed digitally or physically via a subscription model, which maybe seems less sexy and kind of treats the music more like content as you're accessing it in the same way that you would something on Patreon or Twitch. But the fact or the matter is in the digital age music pretty much is content, like anything else. And things like album cycles and the cultural pipelines that they're fed to us through are all a product, an arbitrary product in fact of just like old capitalist models that the music industry has been trying to keep alive for years now. So, of course you're going to have people in the vaporwave community thinking out of that box. After all they did very much contribute to making tapes hip again. And as long as the music's good, what does it matter? And as “Faith in Persona” here shows, the music is good.\r

Now, the projects in this DDS Tape Club vary in terms of style and involvement from respective members. This one in particular was pretty much masterminded by Keith, who has put out a lot of progressive electronic and plunderphonic stuff under the name Giant Claw as well. Certainly his 2021 record “Mirror Guide” turned heads this year. But now, he's getting an even greater reception with this. Which has a lot of the typical aesthetic and compositional trappings of a vaporwave record. The vintage and kind of utopian beats and synth patches, as well as the slowed and pitched and chopped up lead vocal samples. But on this project, Keith's mastery of progressive electronic modes comes together with some of his poppiest production yet, which just makes for one grand groovy futuristic pop flip after another.\r

We have a very strong opener in “Tear in Abyss”. The track features a hypnotic build and one of the most righteous choruses I've heard this year. The whole thing is a master class in repurposing different sounds and samples and inspirations into something entirely different and refreshing. Then, there's the following track “See Me”, which sounds like what you would get if you took musically that part in any given pharmaceutical commercial or a surround sound bump. You know what I'm talking about, like when the logo hits and you get a really euphoric hit of synthesizers or some kind of a very glossy, feel-good instrumentation. Take that part, but turn it into a jam as opposed to like a quick eargasm. It's genuinely beautiful, but also kind of jarring as well to be hit with those rushes over and over. It's amazing that the whole thing comes out so coherent structurally, despite being so jagged in a way.\r
\r
The title track at the start anyway delivers more of those very glossy new age synth textures that vaporwave has appropriated so fantastically. We get more killer grooves, vocal chops and the occasional like prog, jazz, synth lead break. “Pop Chin” throws it back to the 80s with kind of a typical spacey, but urgent dance groove, very much an old school synth pop style, but the modern vocal manipulations, as well as very intricate synth layers and passages brought by Keith, kind of give it a refreshing twist. And it's just hilarious, but also creative, how Keith is able to create such a different and rich world of sound and music based off of the inspiration and sources that he's pulling from. Because, if I'm not mistaken, most, if not all, of the vocal samples on this track are pulled from Taylor Swift's “Cornelius Street” on her “Lover Record”. So, while those vocals are there and they're intact for sure, Keith just comes to very different artistic conclusions with them and it's incredible.\r
\r
“Someone in the Room” is one of the more one-dimensional cuts on the record I thought, but still has a great groove, a hard hitting, the most club friendly track on the entire LP I guess. Then, “Just to be Needed” has to be one of my favorites on here, it is a slow burner to rule all slow burners and has the grace and grandiosity of a great Kate Bush tune. And once more, it's just incredible and impressive how much mileage Keith is able to get out of the source material and ideas that he pulls from because stylistically the acoustic ballad specifically that he pulls the vocals from on this track is just so far removed in terms of emotion and a genre from what Keith actually accomplishes here.\r
\r
Regardless of what genre we put this record under, there are some genuinely awe-inspiring instrumental builds all throughout this track. I mean, screw labeling it as plunderphonics or vaporwave or whatever Keith should be getting paid top dollar to produce backing tracks for top selling pop artists. Especially considering the resurgence of all of the 80s aesthetics that Keith plays with on this thing. I mean, just listen to “Last Minutes of the Memory”, the last real proper song and jam on the project.\r
\r
Following that, we have a semi-ambient closer titled “RIP”, where in a way I think the record processes its own mortality. Plus, it follows an interlude that's effectively I think a moment of silence for itself.\r
\r
So overall, fantastic record, great record, wonderful record, loved it, some of Keith's best work period. Big fat w for the vaporwave community as well, as I hope this album kind of snowballs into something and there have been other releases that have done this, but I hope this record snowballs into another release that kind of transcends the genre and shows people there's like still some serious gas left in the tank of this style of music — this is not just simply a some meme genre of music, it's quite versatile, it's quite dynamic, it has a lot going for it aesthetically and conceptually. And again, I think this record certainly shows that. There are some points where I think some of the vocal layering gets a little weird and pitchy, especially with, again you know, sort of the pitch shifting implemented throughout the LP. Occasionally, some of the builds can run a little bit cluttered, but I think that show of Keith's flying as as close to the sun, as he possibly can on some of these songs and still coming out with better results than most would in this context most likely.\r
