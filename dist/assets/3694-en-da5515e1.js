const e=`Yellow Magic Orchestra is a music trio founded by Haruomi Hosono, Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as Ryuichi Sakamoto. And it's no understatement to say that they are a talent powerhouse that rivals japanese bands and musicians of the past and present. Each member, a prolific composer, multi-instrumentalist and producer with growing discographies packed with city pop, synth pop, various shades of electronic music and ambient music, film scores as well, not to mention that all of them were seasoned musicians before they were even in Yellow Magic Orchestra. I could easily do a video series on each respective members artistic trajectory and catalog. So remember, while “Solid State Survivor” is a great record and I recommend that you listen to it, it's still just a tiny, tiny microscopic snapshot of the entire Yellow Magic Orchestra musical universe. So, if anything this record, if you are unfamiliar with YMO, can be sort of a a gateway for you. Especially since for this classics week, I think “Solid State Survivor” is one of the most currently relevant records that I'm covering. The creative impact of YMO's groundbreaking synth and electro pop can still be felt today in Daft Punk records, in the retro-futurism of vaporwave and synthwave. Quirky indietronica acts like Matmos. Video game music and even hip-hop with one of their earliest cuts “Firecrackers” being sampled by the likes of Africa Bambaataa, as well as De La Soul. Now obviously, YMO's impact isn't always the most direct as they weren't the most commercially successful group in the US outside of a couple small chart positions. Plus, this record here originally only saw release in Japan. But artists, who were in the know certainly took notice and at the very least YMO was ahead of the curve in helping to formulate the blueprint for synthpop, as the US and UK were still working disco and punk out of their systems.\r
\r
The trio also wasn't without their influences and their predecessors. Tracks like Hot Butter's “Popcorn” precede this record by years, though as far as synth pop goes that song is more of a novelty than anything. There was also Kraftwerk too obviously, and like another major influence and predecessor Giorgio Moroder, YMO had the hindsight of disco to make their tracks a little more friendly toward the dance floor. The band's first record was also heavily influenced by a lot of traditional japanese music, which usually manifested in this really cheeky exotica stuff. Which the trio more or less evolved out of by the time they dropped this record, their second one at the time.\r
\r
The opening track “Technopolis” sounds like the dawn of a new era, with its robotic vocal drops and jaunty beats, epic synth leads and grand chords. The Kraftwerk influence is there big time, but it kind of goes harder with the trio smoothing out some of those rigid kinks for something that is just groovier and more lavish. Then, “Absolute Ego Dance” lives up to its title with one of the most killer beats on the entire LP, some really expressive and emotionally complicated synth work too that makes me feel like I'm listening to a dance party that's working through some tough feelings.\r
\r
“RYDEEN” hits a gallop right at the intro of the track and proceeds to burst into these huge, just burning, searing, bright synth chords that I know blew the minds of every japanese video game music composer in the 80s. “Castalia” goes in more of a pensive and contemplative progressive electronic direction, Tangerine Dream fans take notice. There's some good soundcraft at play and it does make for an interesting cool down moment in the middle of the record.\r
\r
The following “BEHIND THE MASK” brings the beat back, albeit a more relaxed one. It's one of the most theatrical moments on the project with some very eerie and grand synth leads. Muddy vocoder vocals I wish were smoothed into the instrumental a bit more as well, even if the track isn't like perfect sounding, it still is as envelope pushing as everything else here.\r
\r
Then by surprise, there is a cover of The Beatles “Daytripper” on the back end of the record. Still to this day, it's a very odd and imaginative revision of the song. Really up there with like Devo's cover of “Satisfaction” on their first record. Like that song, it feels like YMO has taken a few spare parts of the original song and have just gone to insane lengths with it to make something that feels a lot more stiff and mutant, with a more mechanical and throbbing baseline, as well as some glitchy transitions too.\r
\r
The moonlit “INSOMNIA” lurches through the dark, like a devious villain or maybe some kind of nocturnal predator. The starry and delayed melodies on the track are beautiful, there's something really curious about it. Then the punchy closing track finishes things off with a kind of zany bang. Glossy lead synth melodies glide gracefully over some very tense grooves, meanwhile the vocals have a strangely swanky quality to them and are also paired up with these distorted noises that also resemble vocals too. Like it's all a little mangled, but intentionally so and even if that is the case it's still oddly satisfying. Keep in mind though, this is not how the vocals sound on every single YMO record later releases, like “Naughty Boys” — have a lot more clarity and pop sensibility. But by that point, synth pop and new wave have pretty much homogenized into the mainstream style that it was at the time and YMO were merely playing into that creatively and cohesively, but still.\r
\r
“Solid State Survivor” stylistically and cohesively is a bit more of a shot in the dark, which sure does make for a somewhat choppy album flow, but nearly every track on this thing sounds 5 to 25 years ahead of its time. And it's for that reason and many others that “Solid State Survivor” is a special record and also a classic record that you should listen to.\r
