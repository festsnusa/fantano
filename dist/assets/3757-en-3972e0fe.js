const e=`This is a new LP from UK pop singer and songwriter Charli XCX. Her follow-up to a set of records that certainly showed her at a hyperpop peak, the fantastic 2019 album “Charli”, which was my record of that year. And that was a very quickly followed up by “How I'm Feeling Now” in 2020, which was very much Charli's cooped up pandemic lockdown LP — there were many artists dropping these kinds of albums around this point and Charli certainly had one of the better offerings in that realm, really turning lemons into lemonade with a lot of aggressive, left field production.\r
\r
Now, fast forward to the fall of 2021 and Charli begins the promo cycle for this new LP. The opening singles forecast a project that may be a more straightforward pop experience, possibly with an 80s twist, thinking of songs like “Good Ones” or “New Shapes”, but then tracks like “Baby” and “Beg For You” dashed any hopes of this being simply an 80s endeavor. Really right up to the release date, the overall direction of “Crash” remained a little unclear. All that was clear is “Crash” was definitely going to be a departure from the “Vroom Vroom”, “Pop 2”, “Charli” era that in my opinion has resulted in her best output so far. Now, of course this had some fan shaken and a little critical, something Charli seemed to acknowledge in a short departure from social media that she announced on Twitter recently. As well as in her attempts to pitch some of these new tracks to fans.\r
\r
Now, I'm certainly not going to come on here and directly tell Charli XCX what to do with her career and her music, because it's for her to make that decision, not me. But of course, I am free to question the way that this is being framed here. And while the numbers for “Good Ones” and “Beg For You” are good tens of millions of streams collectively, they're not two, three, four fold over the streaming numbers that “Charli” did good. I mean, maybe that could be the case down the road, time will tell. But I guess what I'm getting at here is Charli's last couple of records haven't exactly relegated her to obscurity. And on top of it, aren't there already numerous gateway drugs to Charli's more avant-garde catalog? She does have some of the biggest pop features in mainstream music of the last 10 years — also “Boom Clap”, the song “1999” as well, that track has done over a half million in sales worldwide. None of this is to invalidate Charli's wishes or desires to put out an album that commercially does really well. All I'm saying is that I would hope that “Crash” has more artistic purpose to it other than to be an on-ramp for listeners who, if they heard the “Vroom Vroom” EP, they might hit skip.\r
\r
Either way here, Charli has set expectations for a milder project with a more agreeable approach maybe. And in some respects, I guess that's what “Crash” is. The lead singles, in my opinion, have only lost more and more flavor since I originally heard them. “Good Ones” for example, the rhythm section on this one sounds like a pumped up knockoff of New Order's “Blue Monday”. The vocal performance is fine mostly, but the verses just kind of come off like a placeholder to just lull us into a low expectation point, just so the hook hits a little bit harder when it eventually comes in. And for some reason, I can't help, but shake like this is Charli's attempting a Rihanna's “S&M” type moment here with this anthemic cut, but there's something missing here, just not giving it that “wow” factor.\r
\r
The song “New Shapes” by comparison is certainly more grand in its presentation of just huge-huge drums and bright blaring synth chords. The showy vocal performances from Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens are certainly something too. It feels huge, but no matter how many times I listen to it, I just can't commit that much of it to memory, the song just does not resonate to me as catchy. Plus, the foghorn chorus is just super unpleasant to listen to\r
\r
“What you want\r
I ain't got it”.\r
I like that the song “Beg For You” hits with a nice two-step groove, that's a sweet change of pace. Plus, I've been dying to hear Rina and Charli on a track together for a while now. But is this Charli's best showing lyrically far from it? And the diamond dozens of dance pop synth layers don't inspire much excitement either. “Baby” is still to me a neat little synth funk number with massive sub bass hits. Feels like a legit refreshing take on an old school formula. This is one of the moments on the LP where Charli is throwing it back to the 80s a little, but simultaneously it still feels modern.\r
\r
I wanted to be more excited going into this project, but I just couldn't be based on what I was hearing. All I could do was cross my fingers and hope that the deep cuts were five times better. But sadly, that did not end up being the case. The opening track here — headache. We have more blaring, gated 80s style drums, hitting some really sloppy fills, a truly awful synth and guitar solo at the finish too. In a way I do think the sound of the song ties into the lyrics effectively as it does kind of feel like Charli is against my will pulling me into a car that she is then crashing at 80 miles an hour into a wall, no breaks. Deeper into the record, we have the song “Lightning”, which I am still trying to make heads or tails of. First, how do we have another backing beat that is so obviously pulled from one of the most popular New Order songs “Bizarre Love Triangle”? On top of this, Charli and her producers toss on loads of kooky synthesizers and sound effects, at one point even some classical guitar. And toward the end, we get all of these disorienting beat switch-ups and weird little vocal manipulations, the kind of stuff I've heard incorporated on Charli's more left-field projects previously, but in this instance it just sounds like a mess. Like her and everyone are just throwing in whatever they feel like randomly with no regard as to how the overall track sounds at the end of it. Tracks like “Constant Repeat”, as well as “Move Me” are a little bit more what I was expecting from “Crash” to begin with — very modern pop cuts that are a much easier listen, not a whole lot of bells or whistles, the chorus on “Move Me” has what's easily one of the better vocal performances on the project too, but simultaneously the production and songwriting on these tracks just doesn't feel bright and colorful or fun in the way that much of Charli's songs have been over the past several years, they're groovy, they're listenable, but the risk is low and as a result the reward is too.\r
\r
From here, the final moments of the LP bring a couple of funny highlights. There's “Every Rule”, which is a very spotlit low-key ballad, mostly built on vocals and some very simple synth arpeggios, very cinematic, feels like something straight out of a rom-com movie scene, but still sweet and intimate in the way that Charli is laying out this story about a blossoming love that she's kind of crossing over the threshold into. Then, the song “Yuck” is a straight-up piece of a 90s disco pop, unlike aesthetically anything else on the record, which isn't really a bad thing. Maybe we'd be having a different review right now, if we were talking about a Charli album of a very smooth, groovy throwbacks with nimble bass lines and very sassy choruses. “Used to Know Me” is a super dated piece of eurohouse, I mean, I'm not saying the sound is unsalvageable and that it has a no room in the current dance music paradigm in terms of influence, it absolutely does, but I feel like Charli brought this vibe back without really dusting it off, the whole thing sounds, the way I think ill-fitting vintage clothing looks. Then, finally the song “Twice” leaves the record on some interesting parting thoughts, really the impermanence of some of the things that we tend to build our entire lives around, like relationships etc, with Charli then encouraging listeners to “don't think twice, live your life, do what feels right”. And while that mantra does stick in my head, I'm sad to say the rest of this record doesn't.\r
