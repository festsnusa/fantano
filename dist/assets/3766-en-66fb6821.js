const e=`This is the long-awaited sophomore album of one of the most beloved rappers in the game right now, Playboi Carti. It's only been a few years now really since Carti made his full mainstream ascent, striking gold with a subtly experimental and psychedelic brand of trap music on his “Die Lit” record. Personally, I wasn't really crazy about his breakout mixtape in 2017, nor was I impressed by the round of promo he got out of the 2017 Double XL Freshman class on which he was listed. But I have to admit, everything he was doing around that time set the stage for how minimal, visceral and envelope pushing this project was. Now, the magic of “Die Lit” of course does not boil down simply to Carti's earworm repetitive refrains, because the consistent production from Pi'erre Bourne was also a significant part of the equation.\r
\r
However, on “Whole Lotta Red” he seems to have mostly forgone Pi'erre's production, which I don't see as entirely a bad thing, not just because Pi'erre's sound has proven to be so easily replicable, but a “Whole Lotta Red” should also be an opportunity for Carti to branch out, try something different, not just record “Die Lit” part two. And boy, does Carti branch out on this project, which is not only apparent from the sort of satanic cover art, but also Carti's embrace of vampires and vamp aesthetics in the titles and social media run-up to this record. Looks like Carti is bringing goth to the trap on this one with a sort of punk flare. And while he wouldn't be the first to do that, he certainly is one of the most prominent. And in my opinion, it's these very elements that drive the most interesting moments on this LP. But with that being said, part of me does feel like “Whole Lotta Red” falls short, terribly short of realizing its full potential. Due to not pushing things as far as it could have, while also sounding somewhat half-baked at points. It's worth reminding viewers that Carti dropped this project over Christmas 2020. So maybe the release ended up being a little too premature, especially since he was rumored to have redone a significant amount of the album after numerous song leaks.\r
\r
The tracklist on this thing is also pretty bloated at 24 songs, making “Die Lit” 19 seem trim by comparison, even though the run times between both records aren't significantly different. It's also got to be noted that Carti varies up his vocal style on this record quite a bit too. Not just during the points of this LP where he's straining his voice or screaming, but there are points where he seems to have mostly abandoned the incoherent infantile vocal inflections that he's known for. And Carti's new approaches on this record are genuinely refreshing, it's just a little disappointing when it seems like he doesn't have all the kinks worked out. For one, “Whole Lotta Red” is a record that is undoubtedly abrasive by design, but there are some vocal mixes here and there that leave a lot to be desired, not just because Carti's voice occasionally comes off very pitchy and painful to the ear, but some tracks just don't come off that visceral, because there's a lack of balance between the vocals and the instrumental. This is especially the case for “Vamp Anthem”, a track that I had high hopes for given the aesthetic change on this record, but it really just ended up being this very dry set of trap perks, which is aided by these horrendous midi synthesizers that are playing out this painfully stereotypical vampire intro. However, I will say occasionally this record's messy presentation does work in its favor. there is the insane “Stop Breathing”, which is so heavily compressed nearly every sound in the mix is crackling like a campfire, the result being one of the most deadly and cathartic tracks on the entire record, especially considering the murderous lyrics, gruesome vocal inflections and garish ad-libs. “On That Time” is similarly intense in my opinion, there's also the completely out of control jump out the house, which is packed with this absolutely crushing base and one demented vocal inflection after another, it seems like Carti is pushing a lot of those baby voiced vibes to a new and experimental degree.\r
\r
Then, the track “Punk Monk” may feature one of the most distorted instrumentals on the entire project, but this beat actually ends up being the foundation for a sobering moment of reflection for Carti, where he essentially starts listing out the various ways in which he has been mistreated, ignored, counted out and betrayed in the music industry, naming names as well. There's one particular bar that stood out for me where he says that he's not nice at all and he doesn't even want these other rappers on his songs. It's kind of an anti-social anthem and the scant amount of features on this record certainly reinforces that vibe. And speaking of the features on this record, I think all of them bang. Ye on “Go2DaMoon” sounds completely off of his rocker and that Budapest line is classic Kanye all the way. I also like the experimental string back beat the track delivers too, my one major gripe with it is that Carti doesn't seem to have too much presence on his own song, he comes in, drops a few bars toward the end, Kanye and the beat itself overshadow him greatly. Then, there's Kid Cudi on the track “M3tamorphosis”, whose trademark comes layer harmoniously over a beat that sounds like it sampled the Castlevania soundtrack. Not literally, but the keys on this track make me feel like I'm playing some 2D platformer where I'm stabbing some ghosts and ghouls. Lyrically, this track is pretty focused for a Carti song too with him going into some of the personal and aesthetic changes. Then, there's “Teen X” featuring Future, where it feels like aesthetically Carti is trying to extend the minimal trippy trap sounds he hit upon with “Die Lit”, update them in a way, while Future mostly matches his energy.\r
\r
And while there's nothing necessarily wrong with Carti going back to what's worked for him on a new record. There are points on this project where I think he plays it a bit too predictable and also underwhelms with a supremely disengaged vocal performance. For one, I think he's really phoning it in on the song “Place”. It even features a Pi'erre Bourne's beat — if I had to put this one in a nutshell, I would say it's the soundtrack to not trying at all, a little later the song over sounds similarly lifeless too. Meanwhile, the song “Sky” is a pretty straightforward drug anthem, but the vibe of this track essentially puts Carti in a place of emotional numbness, weak beat choice too I would say.\r
\r
There are some compelling portions of the final leg though. Like the ambitious “F33l Lik3 Dyin”, which features a prominent Bon Iver's [”iMi”] sample. Also, “Die4Guy”, where Carti is reflecting on his past, his paranoia, his brother. But for the most part, this record really loses steam toward the end. I could go deeper into the minor details of this LP, start going over its various flaws, but I think it's pretty apparent at this point that “Whole Lotta Red” is very much all over the place. There are tracks that reinforce more of a vampire or goth vibe, there are tracks that reinforce more of a “Die Lit” 2.0 vibe or maybe even a “Die Lit” 0.1 vibe. There are even some tracks that feel oddly derivative of his contemporaries, such as Young Thug or Lil Uzi Vert. There is some extremely safe and bland production on this thing that bores me to death too. Meanwhile, the more experimental mixes and instrumentals only slap some of the time.\r
\r
So yes, this thing is a flawed record and I could see why it's created such a split in Carti's fanbase. But with that being said, the highlights here are so good, I still understand and see the general attraction that people are having. While I can't rate this record very high, I wouldn't be surprised if this record ended up creating an “808s & Heartbreak” type moment. Where it's not a perfect LP, but the highlights will most likely be adopted by people who are appreciating the record more for its ideas than its execution. And of course, there's always the chance for Playboi Carti to expound upon these themes on a future record, which hopefully ends up coming out sooner rather than later.\r
