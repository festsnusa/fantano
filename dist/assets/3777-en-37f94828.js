const e=`This is the newest mixtape from singer, rapper, songwriter, Sadboys' Sweden's own Yung Lean, who broke almost 10 years ago at this point with his “Unknown Death 2002” tape, which was a pretty landmark moment for cloud rap and internet hip-hop at large at the time. And even though Lean do has successfully operated in this lane for much longer than most, his music to this day still is a bit of a struggle for me to enjoy. I mean, his debut tape, as well as his debut album were pretty much misses for me. “Warlord” though did have some bangers on it. There were also the dreamy tunes and experimental atmospheres laced throughout “Stranger”, which I think has been the closest so far I've come to loving a Yung Lean project. But from there, the following “Starz” felt like a bit of a regression on Lean's part, bringing back many of the weak vocal performances that have made his work difficult to get into for me historically.\r
\r
So, that brings us now to this new mixtape and I usually don't make it a habit to cover Lean's tapes too extensively. I mean, I didn't really make a formal video about his last couple. But I thought this one here might be an interesting change of pace, especially considering these surprise inclusions from Skrillex and FKA Twigs, which lead to some serious highlights on this thing. Like, yeah, the Twigs track “Bliss” I don't know what stars needed to align in order to get these two on a song, but I'm glad they did. Twigs' shouty refrains and Lean's very up close and muffled vocals, plus this new wave beat with the post-punky basslines, some of the weird sound effects that pop up throughout this track too, the mix of sounds and influences on this track feel almost randomized at points, but they still work together perfectly, Twigs colorful and expressive leads are such a pretty and sweet contrast from the very smoky and mysterious verses, the structure of the song overall is great, the production is colorful and crisp. There is also “SummerTime Blood” with Ecco2K and Bladee, which is a drumless number with lots of bright throbbing synthesizer layers, which get deeper and denser at certain passages of the track, Bladee and Ecco2k of course vocally are sounding boyish, angelic, very-very sweet on the ears throughout this cut too. Yeah, it isn't a heavy or hard hitting track, but there is a sweet bliss to it I enjoy.\r
\r
There are some other standout moments on the record too I'd like to point out, like “Nobody Else”, which is a very solemn and wintry number where Lean can be heard rapping about his problems with himself, his solitude. There's something so in his head about it, I just feel like I'm in his mind on this track, it's so internal, everything he's going on about here, plus there's an intoxicatingly chilly quality to the song too. Then, “Paradise Lost” with Antwan, maybe a little long-winded, but there still is something very beautiful and intensely surreal about the production, Lean's loosely rapped verses, the spacious and frosty instrumental is great too, plus I really do appreciate Antwan's bilingual bars.\r
\r
So yes, these are highlights for me, these are tracks on the record I enjoyed quite a bit, but there are just as many others in my opinion that just don't do it for me at all. Like, the song “Trip” for example, which was a lead single to this tape and one that many fans enjoyed, but the out of tune moaning and humming in the background, sometimes in the foreground on this track is just it's too much, it's a deal breaker. And it's unfortunate, because I know Lean could sing better if he wanted to and the tune of the track itself is decently catchy and the track also features one of the most bubbly and fun instrumentals too. Like, it could have easily worked, been one of the best ones here, maybe one of my favorite Lean tracks ever, but it has to be held back by this one thing that he refuses to address. On “Starz2theRainbow” it's kind of like Lean and Thaiboy Digital are in a competition to see who can be the most unlikable singer on the track — all the awkward deliveries, the cracked notes, the strained melodies — like I know vocal styles in that SadBoy, in that drain gang realm tend not to be super orthodox, but like this just is obnoxious and grating. Then, with the song “Lips” it's almost the opposite issue with Lean sounding half asleep on most of the track, though the two-step style beat from Skrillex is a nice change of pace. And with “Waterfall” we get a lot of the same vocal delivery and performance issues, but now just soaked in so much reverb I feel smothered by the whole thing. But I suppose the production is so vast, it gives the track the sensation of feeling larger than life.\r
\r
But yeah, in my opinion overall this tape it's a mix. There's some tracks on here where Lean puts out some great stuff, some of his boldest stuff, cool crossovers, especially with Twigs. But there are so many other cuts here, like usual, where vocally especially I think the performances are just not up to snuff and that's putting it lightly, sometimes they're just straight up bad.\r
