const e=`This is the seventh full-length album from Mr. Chaz Bear under the Toro y Moi name, and one that sees him returning to a more psychedelic aesthetic with a full band of instrumentation. Which is pretty significant, because since the days of Chaz's initial chillwave hype, he has not really been one to repeat himself stylistically with one record after the next. His discography is building up to be a complete kaleidoscope of sounds and musical styles, but “Mahal” here delivers a refreshing version of some of the trippy textures that were laced into 2015's “What For?” — one of my favorite records that Chaz has done so far. Though, I think “Mahal” takes a completely different approach, as it doesn't really rely too much on light lead guitar melodies and lo-fi fuzz to get its point across. Instead, most of the tracks here have a much heavier emphasis on the rhythm section, which is constantly conjuring addictive grooves. There are multiple loud and standout basslines across the tracklist here, also a powerful series of drum fills on the closer. Which just showcased a side of Toro that I don't think is completely alien, but we haven't gotten this clear of a view of it up until now. And there is generally a very refreshing clarity to the material on this project as Chaz really takes the opportunity to strip back many of the effects on his vocal performances here. And microphoning his voice so close, it sounds like he's just literally in your ear. And there's certainly an intimacy to that, especially as Chaz is writing lyrics on these songs, where he claims to be overcoming bouts with self-worth on the song “Last Year”. There are also some pretty interesting themes of loneliness and a need to connect on the tracks “The Loop”, as well as “Postman”. Both of which are some of the catchiest and most fun songs this project has to offer.\r

Though, not every moment in this tracklist is as direct, as there are quite a few pockets on this thing where Chaz spends time hitting listeners with these very surreal, psychedelic jams. Like, the intro track “The Medium” featuring Unknown Mortal Orchestra, which can run a little one-dimensional listening to it, I do feel like it could have used another layer, another detail or some transitions of some sort, but still there is a vivid heaviness and fuzz that I enjoy about it a lot. The song “Déjà Vu” is another textually titillating pocket of this thing, it's absolutely packed with all these squiggly synth beats and reversed guitar layers, that hypnotically swell and fall away across the song. I also love the way these elements pair up with the tracks harmonized basslines and really loose drumming. And again, it's pretty interesting, because there is something kind of trippy and surreal about the way this track is presented, but simultaneously everything is so naked here, it's not like a washing effect, it's not like sounding like it's on the other side of a drain pipe or anything like that. There's something really warm and clear, but also a little strange about it too. I also enjoyed the very gentle and multifaceted “Foreplay”, whose latter half flirts with some jazz inspired melody runs too, occasionally swapping out with these really eerie droning tones, as well as summary guitar chord changes that are pretty interesting. The jammy vibes come back around on the song “Millennium”, which features past Toro collaborators of The Mattson II. And this track aesthetically transitions from sweet twinkling bedroom disco to groovy drum improvs and a pretty quirky jazz synth solo. I wish the vocals had a stronger presence as they do over many tracks here, but this song still does add very positively to the eclectic mix of vibes across this tracklist.\r
\r
Which I should say isn't just randomly thrown together as Chaz does try to play a little theater of the mind with the progression of this LP, trying to portray this entire project as existing in the vehicle depicted on the front cover or at least within a journey happening with it. Because as we move from track to track, we hear the engine running, radio switching dials, the engines starting up. Not to mention some of the songs on this thing transition into each other pretty smoothly too. So, there is like a sense of direction and journey to the way this album progresses for sure. And while this concept doesn't exactly provide the strongest sense of place across the entire thing, I think it does lend these songs more cohesion than they would have otherwise.\r
\r
We have a pretty strong closer on this thing as well, which to me gives off some really strong soft rock vibes with the shiny keys and the super bright vocal harmonies. There is an absolutely insane psych rock guitar solo on the back end along with some of those very strong drum fills and improvs that I've mentioned earlier, which are just so pounding and hard, like I've never heard some live drums go this hard on a Toro record previously.\r
\r
Now, with that being said, I don't feel like this record has the strongest start of any Toro project. “Goes By So Fast” for example is one of a few songs here that I think the song and the tune being delivered in such a detached and passive way, it makes it succumb to just how slow and enveloping the sound of the instrumentation is, something's definitely lost in translation there. I also heard more potential than what was delivered in the psychedelic blues of “Mississippi”, as the track does kind of cut out a little abruptly and it would have been amazing for those blues influences to be embraced a little bit more boldly. The song “Way Too Hot” also could have been extended too.\r
\r
But overall, I think this is a very good album from Chaz, I implore you to not sleep on it. Some of my favorite songs and jams he's ever dropped land on this record. This thing is loaded with seriously catchy, sometimes funny and usually colorful instrumentally highlights. Plus, it has a kind of cute concept to boot. And as usual, I leave this album feeling excited to see what Chaz is going to try next, because every Toro record seems to be an adventure at this point.\r
