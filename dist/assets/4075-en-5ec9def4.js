const e=`Prolific, consistent and cerebral New York rapper Billy Woods, he is back, coming through with a new album after a pretty busy 2022 where he put out two full-length albums. There was "Church" which I wasn't personally crazy about. But we also had the stellar "Aethiopes" which is handily one of the best records out recently in the current abstract hip-hop field. On his new project he's going back to a watershed moment a handful of years ago in his discography, because the passionate cult following that Billy Woods currently has was slowly earned over a course of years with record after record. But the 2019 "Hiding Places", which was produced entirely by Kenny Segal, generated a very large amount of attention for Billy around that time, easily one of the most popular records either of these two have been involved with. And so with fond memories of that album piling up, these guys have decided to link up once again for a full run of songs.\r
\r
If anything was already clear from "Hiding Places", these guys match each other well in terms of vibe. Kenny's often loose, groovy drums, jazz samples and weird textures provide a lot of open space for Billy to work his lyrical magic. Especially on the slowest and droniest cuts of this project, such as "Baby Steps" or the blood curdling "Hangman". As far as Billy goes, he has a style that he's been fine-tuning for years, I feel like I've listened to and reviewed so many of his projects that I forget to re-explain or reintroduce exactly as to why he is so unique and so interesting of a rapper. I take his greatness as a given. But as long time fans know, Billy's distinct delivery and flow usually borders on sounding like a super expressive spoken word piece. His dark humor, dry wit and frank delivery are a deadly combination, especially given his esoteric reference game and gritty imagery.\r
\r
All of which you can hear on the opening track "Kenwood Speakers" — very much a self-portrait of sorts delivered over fat, booming, compressed hits of bass from Kenny. Billy describes driving a beater with aftermarket speakers, he's wiretapped and the way that he's running he should be kissing babies, essentially like someone running for office. He also takes a second to account for the continuous misfortune in his life, talking:\r
\r
"Everytime things going good, having a laff, have to remember,\r
God's a Hater", —\r
\r
following that up with:\r
\r
"Crocodile Tears for ten years plus, don't do me no favors", —\r
\r
which obviously is a comment on his career generally. I would say this track is a pretty accurate depiction of Billy's overall vibe. Which he effectively dives even deeper into on the song "Soundcheck" where he depicts himself as dodgy and elusive, even in the context of a live performance, saying he won't be at soundcheck and he won't be in the green room if it's too lit. He lists a variety of reasons he won't be at this soundcheck, as well as places he'll be at instead. The way the verse flows and repeats, it works a lot like a very topically focused piece of slam poetry. I love the beat, the jazzy upright bass loops, the boom bap drums, the random metallic percs popping up in my periphery, the eerie keys that swell up later in the production adds a very cinematic touch to very rugged and raw bits of instrumentation. Jazz turns up again as a key influence on the track "Blue Smoke" where you have lots of speedy rides and walking bass setting a very fast tempo, Billy hits us with a rapid fire free associative "Chop Suey", which hits a funny peak once he starts rapping from the perspective of FBI agents who are trying to keep track of all the stuff he says:\r
\r
"So much tape hiss, FBI agents narrow they eyes\r
Frustrated, asking to be reassigned\r
"Been on this n-word for months, I think it's all just rhymes.""\r
\r
The vibe is contrasted pretty hard with the following short vignette "Bad Dreams Are Only Dreams": the fragmented samples and loops sound like the jazz soundtrack to a black and white detective movie. Meanwhile Billy pulls together a very surreal verse where he draws a lot of parallels with imagery of a plane crash.\r
\r
However we do have an interesting mood switch up later on the LP with cuts like "Agriculture", which sees Billy rapping with a softened demeanor about things like growth and hope. He depicts himself as a man who's trying to give up his old ways or put himself in a better place, though you still see the residuals of his past life creeping in on him. There are relatively idyllic feelings to the song "NYC Tap Water" as well that honestly feels pretty unique for a Billy record, which has helped greatly by the watery keys and lazy beats provided by Kenny who brings a very versatile array of beats and production on this record. You really don't know what you're going to get next, whether that's very slick and well-oiled jazz rap instrumentation or something much slower, heavy, foreboding, ominous, creepy.\r
\r
Another plus for the album is the excellent array of features. you have Quelle Chris on "Soundcheck" who in his own way backs up a lot of the themes that Billy's bringing. Sam Herring, a Future Islands fame, brings a nice and moody sung rapped vocal appearance on the hook of "FaceTime". Veteran lyricist, extraordinaire Aesop Rock appears on "Waiting Around", which I've never heard Aesop phone in a guest verse before, he certainly doesn't do it here. Elucid appears a couple of times. And if you're not familiar with him, he is the very throaty and cryptic other half of the rap duo Billy Woods is currently active in Armand Hammer. After years of working together, their complementary chemistry is pretty much a given. Especially as he takes the reins on the closing track "As the Crow Flies", which finishes off with a very short, but potent contribution from Billy about fatherhood and mortality:\r
\r
"I'm in the park with the baby on the swing\r
When it hits me crazy, anything at all could happen to him\r
He been climbing higher and higher on the jungle gym\r
Running faster, sometimes pushing other kids\r
Tear-streaked apologies, balled fists, it's a trip\r
That this is something we did\r
I kiss her on the lips\r
I watch him grow, wondering how long I got to live".\r
\r
Detroit legend Danny Brown's feature is amazing, not only he's hyped and aggressive like a lot of his old school verses he used to be. But there's a lot of wild and standout lines, even ones that make Danny laugh in real time at his own pen game. Maybe my personal favorite is one where he's saying:\r
\r
"Niggas illiterate, can't read the room we in\r
So get your cameras out, it's a movie then".\r
\r
Curly Castro and PremRock, who Billy's been known to cross over with a few times, appear as their own duo ShrapKnel, quickly trading off many verses back and forth over the course of the song "Babylon by Bus". Though sidebar on this one, I don't want to forget to mention the closing verse from Billy on this song, which is handily one of the best and most classic of his catalog so far, because it's so just him. With standout one-liners like:\r
\r
"Caught 'em lacking on 9/11\r
I lied down like V.I. Lenin\r
People don't want the truth, they want me to tell 'em grandma went to heaven".\r
\r
There are a few cuts are a bit too predictable by Billy Woods standards if you've been listening to his music for as long or maybe even half as long as I have. Namely moments like "The Layover", as well as "Houdini". But I suppose even average Billy Woods cuts are above average, a few cuts above average than what's generally out there. The hook on "Rapper Weed" is a little clunky and too repetitive, could have been retooled. And "Soft Landing" features my least favorite instrumental with very messily strummed and trebley guitars not lining up that well with the very loose bits of percussion across the track. Those honking distant tones are pretty unflattering and feel out of place. This song would be a complete loss, if not for the particularly determined verse and performance from Billy.\r
\r
Outside of that though, this record, while a little bloated and dense with tracks, we do have 17 clean cuts, a lot of them are shorter, the project is actually great and a slight improvement upon the last record that Billy and Kenny did together, because it's a bit more ambitious, covers more bases, showing their creative chemistry has the capability to see them doing wild and random stuff.\r
