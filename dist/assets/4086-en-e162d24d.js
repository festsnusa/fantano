const e=`A brand new LP from singer-songwriter, painter, sculptor Lonnie Holley. This is his second album for the Jagjaguwar label. And though Holley currently at age 72 has been an artist for decades, he came into music in a professional capacity much later in life. Take that everyone whining on the Internet "ugh, I'm 25 now, my potential for a music career is over". It's been over 10 years since Lonnie's breakout into music with "Just Before Music" in 2012. And now his latest project here is currently his most talked about and well-received to date. And it's not hard to see why. We have consistently impressive features on this thing, from the likes of Moor Mother, Bon Iver, Sharon Van Etten, as well as R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe. We also have pristine, vivid and intergalactic production from Jacknife Lee, which brings the other-worldly qualities of the music here to life. Then, there's Lonnie Holley himself, who is a magnetic vocalist and performer. There's this amazing presence and timbre to his voice, this mesmerizing vibrato as well when he locks into it. His voice also has the smokiness and the texture of an old trumpet. There's a lot of volume, a lot of sustain, a great command of pitch too. But simultaneously, there's something weary and flawed about a lot of the singing on this record, which brings a level of emotional rawness to the table.\r

How expressive of a singer Lonnie is will most likely hit you immediately. And there's nowhere that's better illustrated than in the content of the actual music and how he performs it, how he acts it out. Take the title track for example, which is far from the catchiest and most visceral song on the record, but it's still a prime example of this project's central thesis. We have Michael Stipe singing somewhat eerily in the background of this thing, as elegant piano chords and ambient tones build the track's foundation. Meanwhile, Holley on the track sings through a series of realizations about his own emotional traumas, processing his past, understanding himself and how a lot of what he's dealing with, at least personally, comes down to his family life and his childhood. The track's an emotionally powerful meditation that fuses together elements of ambient music, spoken word and spirituals. There's a piece later on the record that brings together similar genre elements, "Kindness Will Follow Your Tears", which comes to an even grander finish and also includes some great vocal harmony layers from Bon Iver. And lyrically, I read this track to be very much about having an emotional breakthrough of sorts, a profound moment of clarity, with Lonnie getting in touch with his feelings and accepting them, addressing this long neglected inner child in a way. Which he does later on the record in an even more overt way on "I Can't Hush", which is a track that's very much about bottling up various trauma and terrible things from the past and having seen his loved ones and relatives have to do that at various points, sort of embodying that same behavior himself, but simultaneously portraying himself as a baby that can't hush, that has to say it out loud, that has to acknowledge it that is going to break the cycle in a way.\r

The closing track "Future Children" is pretty essential to this narrative as well. Not my favorite cut on the record, as it seems like more of an interlude or fleeting afterthought. We have some repeating synth sequences in the background and Lonnie, vocally on top of that, with some heavy vocal effects to make him sound like a robot, as he goes on about future children dealing with a power failure: no power, signal lost, no winners in the billion dollar lottery. Which is a curious note to end on, but I suppose one that makes sense, given that the opening track on this thing pretty much poses the idea that life and the world that we live in is a series of tests that we have to endure and go through. So that's a quick picture of the record's overall messaging, at least on a lot of the ambient leaning cuts in the tracklist. Which is far from the sum total of this record's sounds and stories. Because there is the song "Earth Will Be There", which brings a panoramic display of meditative horns and percussions, decorated with surreal effects and jazz flourishes. The track sounds like we're going on an intergalactic journey, one meant to make you feel microscopic in relation to the very gargantuan world we live in. But we also take a moment in the midst of the track to zero in on generational burdens brought upon by institutions like slavery, which comes by way of this amazing Moor Mother feature on the song.\r

Deeper into the tracklist from Lonnie, we hear themes of needing protection or even a guardian that isn't there, being lost in a way as well, which is a recurring theme through the record. Like on "If We Get Lost They Will Find Us", which features an amazing vocal performance from Mali singer Rokia Kon√©. From here, I want to mention the track "Mount Meigs", which is handily the most unsettling moment on entire record. Holley reflects on time he spent in a juvenile facility when he was a kid. This would have been back in the 60s, and the whole thing is set to these noisy guitars and blood curdling strings. The finish of the track is absolutely harrowing, as Lonnie describes having the curiosity beaten out of him, damned out of him. It's also pretty clear that this track sits at the center of a lot of the trauma, that relates to all the childhood trauma, that is being knotted toward at various points on the album. "Better Get the Crop in Soon" has one of the most layered and satisfying beats on the entire LP. There's intense sense of unease coming off of some of the horn hits and creepy droning tones in the background too. And "None of Us Have but a Little While" is one of the more linear cuts on the entire record in terms of its large-scale instrumental build, it's so immersive, the fluttering woodwinds, the touching strings, droning horns and reverb drench pianos, you can really swim in this thing. A lot of the lyrics on track come down to our short time here on Earth as individuals, but maybe also as people generally. Our existence is essentially a blink of the eye, but simultaneously the takeaway from this track is also to just realize how precious life is. Which is a message that's also conveyed on "I Am a Part of the Wonder". Although, I will say this is not one of my favorite cuts on the record, because much of the drama that is brought to the table by a lot of these tracks is lost in the faster, funkier beat and electronics in the instrumental.\r
\r
And overall, I do have to say this was a mind-blowing and emotionally impactful project for me. Lonnie, Jacknife and all collaborators involved killed it. The lyrics, sentiments, emotions, themes and concepts on this record are wonderful and focused, consistent. The production, arrangements, layering and performances are great too. And all the features on this thing add to this record in their own way as well. There were a few moments that underwhelmed me a bit, and as an overall project maybe it could have been longer. But outside of that, I don't have many issues with "Oh Me Oh My", it's a beautiful and a profound little album.\r
