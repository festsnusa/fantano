const e=`The fourth full-length LP from old school screamo and post-hardcore outfit Jeromes Dream, a group that formed way back in the late 90s in my home state of Connecticut, and dropped a debut 10 inch that over the years has grown to be a real cult classic for these genres. And how could it not be, with its violently chaotic riffs and drums, shrieking vocals and mathematical grooves that are moving so fast they're beyond calculation. This record is really 15 minutes of pure mayhem. Which was followed up a year later with the record "Presents", which was a bit easier to decipher, but just as zany, with hokey shouted vocals, and riffs that ran like something more akin to a straight up noise rock album. With this thing, Jeromes Dream sounded almost like a different band entirely. The group essentially called that quits after that in the early 2000s, only to make a triumphant return in 2018 with the announcement of a new album that they successfully crowdfunded the recording and release of. The issue though is that the record was a disappointment: the mixes were super messy, the drums overtook everything. And not only that, but the vocals were awful, they had weird, shouty spoken word quality to them that don't quite worked. But hey, weirdly once again, Jeromes Dream was sounding like a different band entirely, with a change up in guitar tones and riffs, and vocal styles. And now, several years later, we have the follow-up to that comeback record, and Jeromes Dream changed it up again, they're sounding like a different band, albeit a better one than what we got on their last LP.

I will say though, the band is sounding harsh once again like they did on the debut, but in a slightly different way. The performances on this thing are more fluid and groovier, not as jarring or disorienting. A lot of headbanging beats and riffs, but that mostly serves as a framework for some of the harshest and most searing guitars I've heard in years. The distortion on this album is more hideous and unforgiving than what you may hear on a lot of black metal records. The bass has a really grimy tone to it as well that links in with the guitars nicely. And the vocals are so loud, nasty and extreme, I get a sore throat listening to them. So, given all that in the very sad, dark chord progressions on these tracks, this thing is a pretty dystopian listen, which rounds out at a very blunt 25 minutes split across 10 different tracks.

Now, to enjoy this thing you've really just got to be done with the onslaught and eat up the dark, noisy little nuances the band works into nearly every moment. Whether that's the hits of feedback in between all the riffs on the opening track, or the bittersweet chord changes that follow, that eventually lead to a murderous breakdown. There's also the sinister chord progression and blast beat combo on "South by Isolation". The skipping snare patterns that follow not too long afterward. The band on this record is not only sounding astronomically tight, but they're pulling off interesting angles with the guitar and drum passages on numerous tracks here. The length, combined with the forlorn chord progressions of "Pines on the Hill", makes me feel like I'm listening to what you would get if you emo violence a Slint song, because there are some intense and harsh synced up riff passages in the first half, but the second feels like a slow downward spiral into a deafening vortex of depression. And it has the lyrics to match:

"I start to go numb
The heat is cold
Lay still
Feel the floor
My legs give out but I want to see your face
one more time before I let you go because
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home".

"AAEEAA" handily has the most dissonant and crushing riffs on the entire LP. Meanwhile, some of the blast beat passages and quickly strung guitars on
"On Holiday With Infinity" gives some screamo, black, shoegaze bands a run for their money. Not that those bands have been super active these days anyway. Some of the chirpy guitar licks and bits of feedback worked into the second half of the song are a sharp move too. And the lyrics essentially tell the story of a guy who sacrifices himself in a very nasty and graphic fashion for metaphorical greater good.

The final moments of this record sees Jeromes Dream in a deep place of despair, with lyrics that I won't spoil. But I will say that the vocals sound way less aggressive and much more defeated than they do on the rest of the LP. The song's closing moments being led by very somber, simple, clean, repetitively strummed guitar chords, leaves things feeling very lifeless and final and cold.

And in a nutshell, that's the record. As far as flaws, I will say there are a couple of tracks that feel like they don't really add all all that much to the overall meta of the album, as the rifts and sonic palette of this thing does tend to run a little one note. There are a couple of interlude type cuts in the mix that do provide some very necessary breathing room. But the core songs of this record could have used just a bit more versatility to them. But even as it currently stands, this is still one of the most thrilling and hard-hitting screamo adjacent records I've heard in a while. And I encourage you guys, and anybody who is even mildly into that style of music or anything that falls under that umbrella, to check this thing out.
