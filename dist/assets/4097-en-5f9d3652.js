So, one of the most popular bands in modern metal music Avenged Sevenfold has come out with a new record here, and it's quite perplexing. I mean, historically I haven't been a big Avenged Sevenfold fan, I thought their music was merely just okay, not quite for me. And look, you guys can go back in the history of my channel, despite the fact that I don't find the band's music all that interesting, I haven't made it a point to go out of my way to crap on their stuff or anything like that, I think they're fine, their music is okay, I see and understand the appeal behind it. And the fact that they have been as successful as they've been over the years, it's valid, it's cool, I get it. But man, they decided to throw a wrench in the works on this new record... No, that's an understatement, they are taking a bunch of different wrenches and bashing the shit out of the works with them and crumbling it to the ground, until the works have been turned to dust. And usually that sort of thing would excite me, I love seeing a band, I love seeing an artist take a risk, do something out there, do something unexpected, that's typically the sort of thing that we celebrate over here on this channel, I like some easy-going, very palatable music as well. But hey, something weird, a left-hook, I'm usually down for it. But in this instance, no. What? How?\r
\r
If I wanted to put this record in a nutshell, I would say that it pretty much sounds like a fish out of water. A fish out of water and in space orbiting Jupiter, gathering speed and momentum, spinning around the planet and then rocketing back to Earth at light speed to hit the surface of the planet and explode and crack Earth in half. Yeah, that's what this record is. Because right from the opening track here, this is supposed to be some avant-garde metal, weird artsy left-field experimental metal, but it does not come off like that at all. Because if you listen to any avant-garde metal, this is so goddamn far off. This is like a single clown standing out in a crowd of demons. Because right from the push of play on this record, it sounds like Weird Al doing experimental metal parody, but there's no jokes in the lyrics. And to make things even more kooky from there, their rock passages that sound like bad Muse worship and then it turns into something that sounds like a bad metal off Broadway musical. If someone tried to do the metal equivalent to "Hamilton", but it came out absolutely unlistenable. And a lot of that comes down to the guitar sounding so thin, the production being so dry, the vocals being so awful. Why are the vocals so bad? Usually, the singing on an Avenged Sevenfold album you could count on as being like everything else they do. But the pitch and the melodies on so many of these tracks are off. The genre combinations are tacky and stomach churning, it sounds like terrible theater kid metal, but not in the cool way that Ghost does. No, this is like a heavy guitar opera, but without any of the knowledge of what makes opera appealing, nor the skill to pull it off. And the lyrics aren't that much better. If I could listen to this "plastic daisies" line again on the song "Mattel", I swear.\r
\r
And somehow as the record continues on, the instrumentals and the vocals get worse. Like on the song "Nobody". What is this singing? Why does M. Shadows sound like he's an excruciating pain all throughout this song? And the more of the track layers up, the more insane I feel like I'm going. From the repetitive shredding to the overly thick, distorted and chorus main riffs, the farting bass notes. I guarantee you this song is making its way to some Guantanamo Bay torture playlist right now. And as if this wasn't bad enough, the following track, which was also a single, "We Love You", is even more unhinged, not because of the sour, gross and hideous jazz metal chords that kick the entire track off. But on top of it, what is going on with the vocals again? Because it's not bad singing now, in the middle of a certain lyrics you'll hear a complete mess. Is this a little "googoo-gaga" metal shit? Not to mention the odd thumping industrial metal passages that are topped with "more sex, more power, build taller, build wider", I'm convinced this band hates their label. And this whole record is an elaborate attempt to prank Warner Brothers, because some of the material on this thing somehow makes the musical world of Corey Feldman sound firmly grounded in reality. And yet, despite how weird it is or it's trying to be, it simultaneously not all that out there, it's like I'm listening to a lesser Mr. Bungle, a Mr. Bungle at home, a boneless Mr. Bungle. The part that's mind-blowing and weird and leaves me flabbergasted is that literally nobody involved with this at any point is like "hey, what? This sounds like a shit". That's the part, that's confusing.\r
\r
However, I will say the fifth track here on this record, that being "Cosmic", this is the most listenable song on the entire album. A lot of the vocal harmonies on this track are actually clean and well crafted. However, it doesn't take long for the band to take things in weird territory once again with some glistening guitars and drums and vocoder vocals, they're sounding like a bit of a "RAM" era Daft Punk for some reason, and that is not the only time that comparison is going to come up, believe me. "Beautiful Morning" I thought was an Alice in Chains cover at first, until the vocals popped in and I realized that there was no recognizably good or Alison Chains-esque melody to be heard. But yeah, that's how derivative the guitars and drums are on this cut. And once again, the lyrics leave a lot to be desired, especially with bars like:\r
\r
"You walk on water, but the water swallows you".\r

And look, I get the dark point that is being made at this point in the song, with the surrounding context of what's being said, but it's funny how this poignant moment is just literally describing what happens when you try to walk on water. It's not a little too on the nose, this couldn't have been put more poetically? We have another weird, tacked on and horrible stylistic change in this track as well, where one moment we're going from these silly and out of tune metal vocals to this sudden change into a sunshine psych pop passage that's a little Beach Boys, a little Willy Wonka soundtrack. Yeah, that, despite it being as serene as it is, is also an extension of the nightmare. It's so frustrating, because none of these songs can decide on one way to be awful. Which is also the case for "Easier", where one moment you have all these smooth, futuristic synths and vocoder vocals. Then, another, you're getting heavy riffs, with vocals on top of it that sound like the front man from Stone Temple Pilots singing into a coffee can.\r
\r
Then, from here we have a trio of songs on the record who like the first letter of each word in the song spells out "God". And it's funny that these tracks are like a part of a trilogy within the record, because you wouldn't think so with them sounding like completely unlike each other and not connecting sonically in any freaking way. The first track sounds like some awful Devin Townsend jazz prog crap, where it feels like Avenged Sevenfold is challenging themselves to conjure as many awful vocal harmonies as they possibly can. Which is pretty much making me feel like track five was purely by accident. Why are all of your vocals so dry, and so flat and so terrible? Like your cousin who got into production eq'd them. Plus at this point, all of the terrible spoken word husky vocals happening throughout the track. Is it adding to a narrative? I don't know, the song is so garbage and the entire record is so annoying to listen to. I can't even be bothered to know what the fuck the narrative of this shit is. Then, the second track in this trilogy "(O)rdinary" is Daft Punk's "Get Lucky", that's what this song is. This song is boneless Daft Punk. Why does this track sound like "Random Access Memories" on a shoestring budget? I swear, these guys got into the Daft Punk album and decided to rip-off a bunch of ideas from it very badly. The final part of this trilogy is a schmaltzy loungey string kissed ballad, it's like metal Frank Sinatra or what happens when you listen to Mike Patton for the first time. And that's effectively the last song on the record, as the closing track is a soft gentle ragged tiny-esque piano piece, it's like some "Fallout" game over screen music, "Cuphead" secret stage, or what you might hear on a "Bioshock" select screen.\r

This album sucked big time, big sucker rooney on this thing. God damn, I mean, I'm sorry if that sounds like rude or rough or overly mean or whatever. And look, nothing in this review against anyone in the band personally, I don't know any of those guys, I don't got beef with any of those guys, and I'm sure they're all nice people. But I have no idea what the hell Avenged Sevenfold did on this record, was trying to do on this record. I mean, I have a vague idea given all the very obvious and lazily xerox reference points, but the execution is severely off. Clearly the band did not have the ability and talent or finesse to truly embody the stuff that was influencing them on this record. And if they were going to do something along these lines, maybe they should have let it incubate a little bit longer. And again, admire the risk, admire the attempt, but this new Avenged Sevenfold record is...\r
