const e=`This is the fourth studio album from rapper, singer, actress, songwriter Janelle Monae, treating us to another detour from her ongoing "Metropolis" series, which she hasn't touched since the 2013. Gans remember back in 2018 the last LP that she came out with "Dirty Computer", while great, was not necessarily the next installment of that "Metropolis" series, which I feel like a total nerd saying, but it's true, the record was pretty much a lot of funky, glistening, conscious future pop, dealing in feminine energy and living free, sex and sexism, as well as spitting in the face of bigotry in an anthemic way. There was a lot of very pretty and modern production on this LP, songs that popped, it may not have had the transhumanist ambitions of her earlier work, but still great.\r

Now, "The Age of Pleasure" also seemingly exists in its own world. Thematically speaking, it is possibly Janelle's most human album yet, as the project doesn't seem to concern itself with technology much at all. This record conversely is more about celebrating the self and having parties and having sex, specifically with respect to queer love. And a lot of the tracks on this LP flow into each other really tightly too, making the entire project feel smooth, multi-phased, cohesive experience, which is cool. I mean, for one thing it does keep the record from feeling as scant as it is at 32 minutes. But there are other things about the album that feel off.\r
\r
For one, a lot of the instrumentals from this thing pull inspiration directly from reggae music, the most prominent influence on the entire record honestly. But by that same token, up until this point I don't think a Janelle record has sounded so stiff, robotic and sanitary. And look, I Love reggae, especially deep, thick, bassy dub reggae. But the renditions of reggae music on "The Age of Pleasure" are often very thin, synthetic trap fusions that are so regimented and so commercial that even Seun Kuti and Egypt 80's horn sections on the opening track "Float" could barely breathe life into the song. The following "Champagne Shit" by comparison does have a bit more punch and a bit more groove to it, but the difference is in night and day. Janelle's fun vocal harmonies and glamorous bars are the selling point to the track. Though again, some of the vocal layering on this project comes off so sanitary and so processed that the singing comes off a little one-dimensional, not wide or full or big in the way that good group vocals sound. This being most obvious on songs like "Water Slide". The rhythms and instrumentation on "Phenomenal" by comparison do come off a bit more organic, which is nice, it's like a driving, jazzy, eccentric vogue anthem that's equally sexy and hypnotic. And I love the way the song smoothly transitions into the following "Haute", so tightly that it pretty much feels like an extension of the same song.\r
\r
Then, there's "Lipstick Lover", which was another big single from the album cycle, which leans into the records reggae influences in a big way. However, again, instrumentally the rendition, the version of this genre that we're hearing, feels very skeletal, very thin, not a whole lot of bass or body to it. Just like with the song "Float", but, in the case of this track, the lyrics are so painfully on the nose. At least with a song like "The Rush" you are getting a touch of innuendo, and there's some poeticism going into the sexual imagery. But here on "Lipstick Lover" the lyrics often read like horny texts. Also, for such a sexual album, it doesn't often feel very sexy.\r
\r
I will say this, though there is an eerie beauty to the song "Know Better" that I like a lot, also hearing that darkest light horn sample in the distance, that was a nice touch too. There's also an attempt on this record at "I Only Have Eyes For You" interpolation on the song "Only Have Eyes 42". Again, musically very much the same song, but lyrically flipped on its head to be more about polyamorous love and threesomes. Which thematically is fine, it's cool, the reframing of that song in this way just comes across as tacky, even if I vibe with the lyrics and the bridge instrumentation, as well as vocal leads. The closing track "A Dry Red" is a short afterthought with some very clever and suggestive bars here and there, makes the entire record feel like a short-lived summer fling or a dream of some sort that we're now waking up from.\r
\r
And overall, I thought this record was okay, very light on the ears, not a whole lot of depth to it, far from Janelle's best crop of songs, I'll say that for sure. Not all that exciting and again, with a lot of these stiff production and very flat and touched up vocal layers, it doesn't come off as that visceral or that sexy or in the loins. Which is the least sexy way I could go about verbalizing that. I'll put it this way, the record doesn't so much feel like a direct connection to sex, as much as it feels like the usage of sex to sell me something, like in a commercial. Be it beer or cologne, or some revealing swimwear, or a sex toy. So, in that sense, the record does miss the mark, even if it is overall decent and a cut above most of what gets released in the mainstream.\r
