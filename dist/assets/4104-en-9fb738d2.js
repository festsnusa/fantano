const e=`This is a brand new LP from UK singer and songwriter Archie Marshall, aka King Krule, a guy whose music has been on a remarkably despondent trajectory for a minute now. So much so there have been moments that I've just found to be straight up unpalatable, most notably the fan favorite _["The Ooz"](/videos/2412)_ — an incredibly repetitive, dreary and skeletal record whose fans love to just wallow in if this top comment from a previous review is any indicator. However, I enjoy the follow-up to this project several years later, _["Man Alive"](/videos/3143)_, which delivered similarly depressive vibes, but actually focused them into song structures and performances that had impact. And "Space Heavy" is turning things up on the visceral side too.\r
\r
Don't get me wrong, this thing is still a very dark and moody record that most likely you are going to need to be in a certain headspace for. But that does not stop Archie from flexing his songwriting skills and delivering some pretty fiery performances. Whether it be on the thumping beats and milky post-punk basslines, as well as punk, jazz passages throughout the track "Pink Shell" — a moment where the album makes me want to lose it. There's also the climactic finish of "That Is My Life, That Is Yours" that also features some whaling saxophone too. Meanwhile, "Hamburgerphobia's" tight drums and chorused detuned riffs bring this intense sense of unease, over which Archie in this very cold, dead spoken word delivery talks about all these harsh interactions within a romantic relationship, and they're fragmented, they're odd, the whole thing sounds like a nightmare.\r
\r
Now, this record is not all piss and vinegar. There are a lot of low-key moments in the mix as well, many of which are incredibly catchy and emotionally impactful, even if they are a little understated. There's the spacey and strange opener "Flimsier", which is a perfect tone setter for the album, not only in terms of the loose and agonized rock instrumentals you are going to hear throughout the rest of the project, but the lyrics very much deal in a romantic connection being over, being thrown away. And there's a heaviness to the feelings on this track that cannot be described in words, even Archie's refrains of feeling the weight of the word don't seem enough. There's also the track "Seaforth", which is very airy and enchanting drum machine dream pop, which lyrically is one of the few moments on this LP of positivity and hope. Archie sings about being freer than a bird and overcoming dark days and having faith. Then, on "Tortoise of Independency" we have some heart-wrenching chords set to a very odd poem, where Archie is comparing himself to a tortoise as a means of showing himself walking slow and taking in everything happening in the moment very slowly as to try to string moments out, make them last as long as possible, while also waxing poetic on long gone memories.\r
\r
The track "Our Vacuum" is built off of these warbly little guitar licks that feel like something out of a Mac DeMarco song, with some very sharp and soft melodies. And lyrically here, Archie describes a very powerful monologue, like an isolated place of love and connection, some sort of vacuum, using lyrics like:\r
\r
"In between the gaps of the stars, we lay in the dark".\r
\r
Toward the finish, we have another powerful moment on the record, "If Only It Was Warmth", which lyrically is one of the more redundant tracks here, but it certainly ties up a lot of the feelings of sadness and remorse on this LP, disappointment as well, stating over and over toward the finish "if only it was warmth that you held". The jazzy guitar chords underscore these refrains, enhance this part of the song too.\r
\r
I'll also say, this is a pretty long and dense record as well. So of course there are a few tracks that pale in comparison to others. Be that "From the Swamp" where the steady rock grooves in the background stale out after a while, not to mention the watery overwhelming guitars on this cut sound like they were mixed by somebody half asleep. Though, I will say the instrumental arrangements and effects throughout this album are really creative, unique and surreal. The entire record sounds like it exists in a world of its own, a desolate and lonely plane where it is nighttime and below freezing 24 hours a day. The vocal change up from featured artists on the LP Raveena is a nice bit of added variety on the LP. Though, I do think the verse vocals come off a bit too hushed and understated. And overall, the song feels like a glorified interlude, even if it does back up some of the lyrical themes earlier on the LP. Again, very interlude-esque and doesn't add as much as shorter moment, such as "Flimsy". As well as the track "When Vanishing", which is mostly an instrumental cut, string kissed, some jazzy embellishments on the back end as well, and it's a beautiful moment on the back end of the LP that brings us toward its final moments. Which are mostly dictated by "Wednesday Overcast", narratively I see this track as an epilogue for the record, we're not so much in a moment of agony or angst over everything that's happened, feels like we're at some point into the future, Archie is talking about somebody, potentially the person being sung about mostly on this record, being back around in the area, looking for him. What that leads to isn't spelled out super clearly, but what is obvious as it is said in the lyrics is that a lot has changed since this time:\r
\r
"My head was empty\r
My life was discreet\r
A lot has changed\r
Not a lot means to me."\r
\r
I do love the instrumental on this track. Though, I will say the very distant and cold flatly delivered spoken word vocals don't do a whole lot for me. But again, I do respect what this track does in terms of tying a lot of the narratives up with a bow, and doing so in a pretty self-affirming way that shows Archie in a new, a different and hopefully a better place since when everything sung about on this record transpired. Honestly, very sad, very potent, very powerful little record, and one of Archie's best and most impressive releases so far.\r
