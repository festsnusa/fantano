const e=`This is the newest full-length album from Australian rock chameleons King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, their 24th I believe. The band is as prolific as ever, fresh off of dropping three full-length records last October. And the band still somehow sounds refreshing and adventurous every single time they come through with something new. Whether it was the very dancy and playful "Changes", the jammy, long and multi-phased "Laminated Denim", or the conceptual "Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava". But this time around on their latest effort here King Gizzard is heading back into some familiar territory. The band is typically known for their fusions of psychedelic rock, garage and maybe a touch of punk, but there is one record in their discography that is more of a high concept, thrash metal sci-fi epic about the end of the world "Infest The Rat's Nest". And "PetroDragonic Apocalypse" is very much bringing similar vibes.\r
\r
Just from the title of the album and the album cover alone it's pretty clear that the band is, once again, focused on the idea of an environmental catastrophe ending the planet. And stylistically, of course, King Gizzard is heading back into the metal realm. But you would be mistaken to assume that this is yet another simple thrash excursion, because with King Gizzard nothing is ever just that simple. I would say they're dabbling a little bit more in heavy metal and progressive metal aesthetics on this record with multiple phases, anthemic solos and odd time signatures flowing throughout these sometimes eight or nine minute ragers. This project is also just 7 tracks long, so far from the longest King Gizzard record, but it's still a super satisfying run of songs. Especially since the various melodic and narrative themes tie the whole thing together pretty neatly.\r
\r
There's "Motor Spirit", which is the opener and a fantastic tone setter, shows the album's visceral and also meditative range right off the bat, with killer drumming, fuzzy, driving riffs, unhinged guitar solo passages too. It's nothing, but high octane metal mayhem with the blunt force and speed of a Motorhead song. After the first third of this song though the track suddenly shifts into mystical psych metal passage with lots of exotic hand percussion bits thrown in, eerie background vocal harmonies and what sounds like throat singing in the foreground too. I'll say "watch out, Tool, you're not the only stoner prog psych metal band on the scene now". Similarly King Gizzard drops weird hypnotic mantras throughout numerous parts of this record. But the way the band applies it, it's ingenious, because it plays into the story behind the song. Likening humanity's adherence to gas and oil and combustion engines to the religion. It's like a cult worshiping a God.\r
\r
And there are similar themes cropping up on the song "Supercell" too, but this time the tables have turned and now extreme weather events are coming around to bite us in the ass for the destruction of the environment: tornadoes, supercell storms, a lot of violently apocalyptic imagery with some amazing and super snappy group chorus vocals. It's very direct, hard-hitting, as are the next few tracks on the record too. There's "Converge" with more high intensity drums and guitars, switching off with the zany, but sharp lead melodies that sync up with the vocals and lyrics. I can't get enough of the intense energy and detail the band is putting into this record already, it's got me on the edge of my seat, even when they bring passages like on the end of this track where they once again go into a meditative mode.\r
\r
There's also "Witchcraft", which features guitar and vocal melodies singing hand in hand. I would say this song is maybe the most usual sounding King Gizzard cut on the entire record: the guitar work feels way more psych than it does metal, you even get the trademark "wooh" that we've heard on many fantastic and exciting King Gizzard jams in the past, most notably on "Nonagon Infinity". Narratively, on this track the storms that were previously mentioned on the past couple of cuts are destroyed everything, but now the narrator of the track is calling upon witches to put a stop to the whole thing. But in employing magic, some tragic stuff happens and we somehow end up with "Gila Monster", which the following track on the record is all about. And this song was the lead single to the record, and when I first heard it I thought by King Gizzard standards, especially with them treading back into metal territory, it was a little basic. But now that I've had the chance to listen to the song within the context of the album, it's a respectable inclusion on the record, especially since the huge group chants on the tracker hype as hell and it does add an epic twist to the climax of this story: rather than storms and witchcraft we have a giant lizard to deal with, eating the witches. I guess, one has to wonder is what's going on here literal, is it metaphorical, 'cause in a way the witchcraft can be a representation of our cheap hubristic corner cutting to try to stop the apocalypse that we created from killing us. Or King gizzard could have something against wiccans, and they want to see them eaten by a lizard.\r
\r
So, narratively on this track thus far we have that "Motor Spirit" thing, which is almost like an old God. And now the "Gila Monster" is a new God, which the progression of that is detailed in the following 9 minute and 45 second "Dragon". That combined with the following track "Flamethrower". The closing cut on the record is also over 9 minutes, the final moments of this record are pretty ambitious, pretty large scaled.\r
\r
Narratively, so far on the record, it's important to note how everything awful on this album is like a domino effect an ongoing domino effect into another awful thing. This is an unhinged, environmentalist, cautionary tale version of when you give a mouse a cookie, because now the dragon is drinking motor oil, and as a result result of that it's throwing flames, the world is burning, you hear the motor spirit mantra coming back toward the end of the song, with a psychedelic synthy variation thing going on.\r
\r
And it's quite a metamorphosis this record undergoes, sonically and conceptually. Yeah, I loved it, I was impressed with it. I mean, there was a little bit of a one-dimensionality going on in terms of the color and the textures of the instrumentation on this record could have been a little bit more vibrant instead of as as fuzzed out and as distorted as it is sometimes. But still, I was impressed with what the band brought on this LP and it's a pretty much on par with their previous "end of the world" concept metal album.\r
