const e=`New record from groundbreaking and influential Atlanta vocalist and rapper Young Thug who we haven't heard from since 2021's "Punk". Which is understandable, because as of 2022 Thug has been tied up in the court system, exactly the sort of thing that would kneecap in artists commercial output, as it's rare you get a rapper or a writer like O3 Greedo or Gucci Mane, or Juice WRLD that has just so much stuff recorded in the vault that you can just release project after project, after they are either gone or blocked down. However, Young Thug has proven to be one of the more consistent and prolific artists of his generation, I have to imagine there's got to be some stuff on the cutting room floor worth releasing. Which is why we have this new project out, it's been executive produced by Metro Boomin. I imagine Thug's team pieced this together mostly from older material. That was more or less confirmed over the weekend as a spare bar from the song "Want Me Dead". I was confused as potentially being a diss against the rapper Saweetee. Young Thug's twitter account confirmed that this wasn't true, not just because of the way he said the word sweetie in the song, but saying the track was six years old.\r

With the material on this thing being leftovers, of course there's not much on this record in regards to Thug's current situation. The closest we get to that is a spare interaction between Drake and Thug on the intro track over what sounds like a penitentiary phone call. Not long after the bar:\r
\r
"Business is business, you owe me this time\r
Slime on your head, Nickelodeon time".\r
\r
Also, this weird one from Thug:\r
\r
"Made a jail call to your bitch, she say you down\r
You a bug in the grass, finna get ate by my cow",\r
\r
is sort of odd, but maybe the upside of releasing material, that's on the older side of things or just left over, is we're going going to hear some stuff that's potentially unorthodox or was seen as maybe a bit too odd to put out. Which is certainly the case for "Money on the Dresser" where Thug delivers a bunch of zany inflections over a quirked up trap beat. There are some simple what sounds like Carousel organ notes in the mix as well, didn't expect that. And while the cut may be more of a vibe than a well-crafted song, it's still interesting to hear him in a eccentric moment. I would say there's similar vibes on the track "Gucci Grocery Bag" where it seems like the song's appeal is mostly couched in it being slightly absurd. The refrain is quite an earworm, but I will say the verses are so understated, they almost feel like just filler placeholders that might have been replaced with something bolder later down the road. However, "Cars Bring Me Out" is a complete and utter anthem, I'm actually upset we didn't get this track earlier, especially with the sad, plucky folk melodies laced into the beat. Thug's deep and authoritative verses on this cut show him vocally in a slightly different light than usual too. Whole thing sounds like some glamorous mafiosa rap. Plus, Future is a solid edition of the track too. "Jonesboro" doesn't have a whole lot of lyrical focus, or at least not the level of lyrical focus I would want from a song that in tone seems to be so personal and intimate. But it is still a nice nostalgic breath of fresh air in the tracklist. The distant and moody pianos on the beat are quite nice.\r

There's some somewhat left-field and unexpected highlights on this record. And then, there are other cuts that you could see why Thug and his team weren't necessarily in a rush to release them. You have some stiff and meandering performances over some very awkward and boring instrumentals. Like in the case of "Hellcat Kenny". Uncle M has a cool flow, but not much else. No real song developed out of this one sadly, which is unfortunate because I do think there are some aspects of the song that are genuinely intoxicating, the instrumental for one and some of the moments where Thug is sliding on certain vowels or elongated notes in his flow. On "Wit da Racks" Young Thug goes off on his introverse, but 21 Savage and Travis Scott to follow, not as much, their additional features later on the LP are much more interesting. Then, "Went Thru it" sees Thug rapping in this inflection that is so insanely squeaky with tons of vocal fry on it, it's a chore to listen to.\r
\r
And as desperately as Thug's team and Metro Boomin try to turn the song "Global Access" into big, triumphant statement about Thug being locked up and the unfairness of the American legal system and how he's being crushed. All of which is pretty much couched in this triumphant vocal intro.\r
