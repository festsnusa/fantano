const e=`Soap&Skin is an Austrian singer-songwriter, this is her second full-length album "Narrow". I've been listening to it on and off for a few weeks, and just about everything about this thing is sticking with me and making me want to return to it from the emotions, the songs, the production, the vocals. And the vocals are definitely the most distinct things record has going for it, Soap&Skin has very deep, somewhat bellowing, smoky, womanly voice that reminds me of artists like Nico. Soap&Skin is definitely just as good at projecting emotions in her songs. She just makes very simple piano ballads with a lot of space, very bleak, somber, dreary stuff. Soap&Skin is so good at pulling these kinds of emotions together, she completely transforms one track in a cover song. The song "Voyage Voyage" by Desireless, which was once a synth pop tune from 1987, but she makes it into something that is way more dramatic. The track starts off pretty quiet and then it evolves well with strings seeping in subtly underneath her voice. And the song to me gives feeling of waving goodbye to somebody who's rowing away on a little boat into the fog and in the darkness.\r

The track doesn't have a huge climax to it, but the opening song definitely does. And it builds up a lot of tension up to that point too. And it doesn't just for vocals and piano, Soap&Skin sometimes has very weary and emotionally draining quality to her voice. But a lot of these tracks she will match that up later in the song with vocals that are much more intense. On this opening track "Vater" the tempo starts speeding up, and, just before the song ends in the last 50 seconds, it explodes in awesome jubilee of horns and strings and vocals and drums.\r

There are some very soft and short songs on here too. And even though they are, so a lot like that Perfume Genius album that came out this year, they still pack a pretty heavy emotional punch. Especially the song "Wonder", which finishes off with whisper quiet group vocals. And it's like a depressing lullaby, feels like I'm being sent off to sleep, in a good way, not a boring music kind of way. Though, most of this album is pretty soft and quiet and sad and piano-driven, there are a few left hooks, which is good. The song "Deathmental" takes in industrial turn for the album: this banging, clanging percussion, synth that feels so rigid, â€” it's like listening to a hellish assembly line. But Soap&Skin's vocals are still there, which take the edge off a bit and still keep the enchanting quality. The last track goes down the same road with some hard drums, some buzzing in the background too. The sounds are a bit harsher, but that element of piano balladry is still there. So, it's a nice combination.\r

My only real gripes about this LP, and a lot of fans of Soap&Skin may be feeling the same way as I do, this album is painfully short. There are a few tracks that are just around two minutes and I'm totally fine with that, those songs have an abrupt charm to them. But I just wish there were more tracks on here, more material. And there's nothing particular about the flow of these songs either as an album that makes me excited to listen to all of them from beginning to end. But still, I can't say anything negative about the songs themselves when I take them away from the album and look at them, because I enjoy each one. The songs are consistent, they've got tasteful production, great vocals, this album delivers something that's very personal, very quiet, very emotional. It's an album that may make you without a few tissues wipe some tears. If that's the thing you're looking for, I definitely recommend this.\r
