const e=`This is Fiona's first full-length album in about seven years and in the internet age even taking a few years to come out with your new album seems to be becoming a longer and longer time . So, I think there may be some people watching who aren't necessarily 100% familiar with Fiona Apple, her style, her work and everything like that. But she's the kind of artist who you don't necessarily need to go scope all of her older albums in order to appreciate what she does, because she's been so consistent in her sound and her style with album after album just slinging these piano rock tunes backed by drum and acoustic bass. And on all of her albums as well, including this one, Fiona shows that mark of a great songwriter in that she can send a really strong emotional connection with the listener through her music. Make the emotions feel tangible for the listener, even if the story in the song is very personal or difficult to relate to. Not only does Fiona have this characteristic, but I would say she's insanely gifted in this department, more than most. With her really tense singing over most of her songs, you get the sense that she can snap at just about any moment and sometimes she does. And she writes very poetic lyrics, detailing a myriad of just really nasty situations, but for the most part about relationships gone sour.\r

And sometimes even lays the blame on herself like the song off this album “Werewolf”, where Fiona is basically singing about how bad this person is relating them to a shark, relating them to a werewolf, but then admitting that she provided the bloody wound in the water or the the moon that would actually turn this person into that, she teases out the terrible side of this person. Though, characteristics like this are pretty much on every Fiona Apple album, there are variations and I would say the “Idler Wheel” sees her using her usual tropes, her usual emotions and bringing them to a new kind of unsettling and disturbing intensity. And it's kind of a nice change of pace, considering that her last album was really sweet by comparison to her other releases — it was a lot poppier than her usual stuff, it had the personality that you would expect from a Fiona album, but the edge was really taken off by some really sweet and sometimes jazzy horn sections and some baroque strings too. I would say, “The Idler Wheel” strips things back a bit, it has extra instrumentation, but it's used subtly for the most part — it really subtracts the sugar, and I think it's the better for it, it's made a more emotionally potent album. I'm loving the sound of the instrumentation on this thing — the piano, the bass and the drums — it's Fiona's usual foundation, but it sounds so punchy and modern, and crisp on this thing. And the performances just sound refreshing and that they have a lot of energy, they sound kind of live or at least semi live on this album Fiona's vocal delivery and her piano playing are just really fantastic, and the bass and the drums kind of come in and punctuate that throughout a lot of these songs. And I would say in addition to her usual instrumentation, Fiona is experimenting with sound a little bit more too. There's some shuffling percussion on this track, there's percussion on here that that kind of tips its hat to jazz, there is a track on here where there's a sample of kids yelling and playing. There's another track where it sounds like the percussion is made of nothing but glass bottles and tin cans.\r

The song “Regret” actually has an ominous drone hanging in the background. These subtle little sonic editions on almost every track really do separate the songs nicely and bring a different flavor to all the tracks here. On the opening track, I feel like Fiona is not singing, as much as she is acting throughout this song, she is just telling this really intense story of these internal emotional battles over these very chilly celeste chords. The song “Daredevil” is kind of about Fiona being sort of personally addicted to emotional extremes and the music fits it perfectly with these really punchy piano chords. And lyrically, she's really kind of clever and hilarious, relating the situation to being a daredevil and needing a chaperone.\r

And there are these very kind of weird, but very purposeful personality contradictions on this album, like for example Fiona feels really like legitimately hurt on the song “Valentine”, which is a song about one we're quite in love, but then again she'll turn around and sing the song left alone, which is pretty much about being the kind of person you can't really love back anyway. Not only does Fiona tell these stories really well, but they're spots on here where it just feels extremely beautiful and sort of actually scholarly with how chill tree some of these situations, with one of the hooks kind of saying there's nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key. But then again, Fiona can be really twisted with describing a certain situation like soaking up hot piss with white dove feathers. There is actually a lot of symbolism to that image and just the image alone outside of these symbolism is pretty disturbing. Time and time again, Fiona really does get her point across like nobody else.\r
\r
Overall, I really don't have any huge complaints about this album, I feel like the track “Jonathan” could have used more, I guess, contrast between the chorus and the verses. The song “Hot Knife” at the end, which I think is really kind of fun closer and has some more great lyrics — I didn't really care for the multi-tracked chorus vocals on the song and just felt a little distracting, I guess more than natural. And as much as I would have liked to have heard Fiona kind of reinvent herself with this album, I am extremely happy with what she did, which is actually just kind of refine her usual sound to the point where, once again, it sounds fresh, it sounds exciting, it sounds detailed and well-written and most of all hard-hitting. Production, performance, personality, songwriting, I mean, for me it's all here on this album.\r
