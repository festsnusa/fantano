const e=`In case you don't know, The Roots are a hip hop band and this is their 9th studio LP. I know some of y'all who are in my subscriber base don't like hip-hop, I don't know why. But if you were to try one contemporary hip-hop act, The Roots are one of the few groups I would highly, highly recommend. Not only for their live, dynamic instrumentation, but for the heavy soul, funk and jazz influences that just pour out of their music, Something that a lot of modern gangsta rap is completely devoid of. The band has had a lot of lineup changes since their inception, but their core is still intact, with Questlove on drums, the lead MC Black Thought and Kamal Gray on keyboards. Around this simple skeleton some of this group's best material has been written, and that is no less true for this album.\r

Right from the start of the track "Walk Alone" the band builds a song out of some chunky drumbeats and somber piano chords, and from this come something emotionally impacting. This song also hits a real homerun with the chorus, and most of the tracks do. It avoids something that bugs me with a lot of modern hip-hop music, where it'll try to pose a real attitude in the verses and the rhymes. But once the chorus comes around, it'll put some corny, overly sweet sing-songy voice into the hook, which turns me off. However, The Roots are very conscious of that emotional balance on this LP and make sure all the pieces to the puzzle fit. Long story short, these songs are built solid brick house. And a lot of what makes the tracks on this album stand out from one another are the fantastic and well-thought-out guest spots. vocals from Monsters of Folk, John Legend and even Joanna Newsom brings some emotion to these tracks that just could not have been there otherwise. With the girls from the Dirty Projectors showing up on this thing too, there is quite a bit of indie star power throughout this new The Roots album.\r

But I'm very pleased to say that this thing is not over shadowed by its guest contributors, even its guest MCs. I'm no The Roots expert, I haven't heard all 9 of their studio albums, and the ones that I'm most familiar with are "Organix", "Do You Want More?!!!??!", "Things Fall Apart". And I've been listening to a little bit of their more recent material too. But from what I can gather, this LP is one of the most downtrodden, sobering albums I have ever heard, much less ever heard from The Roots. Which is funny, because, from what I've read, the band perceives this to be an overly positive album, a very positive album. I mean, if this is positivity, I don't want to see negativity. But honestly, it's not like this album is suicidal, it doesn't see life as pointless, it doesn't see life as futile. I guess, the way I could put it best is that this is the sound of being fed up.\r
\r
Politics and social issues have always played a huge part in The Roots' music. And that's also true on this album. And to be honest, why wouldn't The Roots be fed up? The world sucks right now: war, oil leak, racial injustice, sexism, pollution, poverty. I mean, look outside Black Thought and guest MCs like P.O.R.N., Phonte and Blu paint a rough, but relatable sketch of the political climate according to them. And to me it hit a good balance between being enjoyable, being clever, being well-written and preaching a little gospel too (though, this album may be too "preachy" for some people...). The way I see it, it's like reporting. Feel free if you want to disagree, but this is the world according to us. It's hard not to feel the struggle that these MCs are in the rhymes. And that just makes this album so much more of a powerhouse.\r
\r
My one gripe, and believe me it's just one, I don't have much to say about this album in the realm of negativity, is that the last two tracks just feel very out of place for me, like bonus songs. Because they break the emotional narrative of this album and they break the subject narrative of this album quite a bit. Especially the track "Hustla", which is coming out of left-field. Which is why I understand them shoving it at the end of the album.\r
