const e=`Charli XCX is an English pop music singer, who has been gathering quite a bit of buzz over the past few years over a bunch of pretty hot singles. Songs like “Stay Away”, which in my opinion is attractive, is incredibly well-written, really melodic and has a very modern synthetic feel to it, but with a bit of a 80s new wave chic. Or the song “You (Ha Ha Ha)”, which a lot of people remember for its very interesting use of a Gold Panda's sample. Tracks like these that featured really interesting and sort of progressive production really forecasted Charli to be an artist who is going to be a little bit more eclectic than your average modern pop singer. However, I don't really feel like that ended up being the case, even though there are a handful of decent songs on this album and some likeable instrumentals, I think this album is sort of a case of taking something, smearing it in some extra makeup, wrapping it in some edgy clothing and then selling it as being sort of original or different.\r

I gotta say, track after track on this LP, Charli XCX has a very very passable voice. And not that she doesn't have pitch or range, really my issue with a lot of these tracks is a lack of interesting emotion coming from these vocals. Despite a lot of the emotional and sort of romantic themes that come out of the lyrics on this album, Charli's voice doesn't really come off as all that moving to my ears, it almost gets borderline ridiculous as she embarks upon many many very slowly wrapped verses. And what makes these parts so ridiculous are some of the silly, just sort of cliche lyrics.\r

While, I have nothing against this album's blend of house, pop music, just dance pop in general, as well as synth pop, I just feel like Charli XCX doesn't bring that much flair or personality on this record. Though an album like this, a very short sort of concise, very bright electronic pop record can be great sometimes, sort of a breath of fresh air, a break from some of the more serious music out there. I just don't really have a lot of faith in this album to navigate its way through the modern pop landscape, when it doesn't really make an effort to define itself within that. Instead, there are too many moments on this album where it embraces some of contemporary pops worst characteristics. Like, the song “Nuclear Seasons” that opens this LP up, while I do like the start of the track, Charli's voice is just really ethereal, off in the distance, it has this really airy production that sort of reminds me of Grimes a bit. Once the song moves past its intro and the chorus is pretty decent on this thing too, the verses are absolutely boring, don't feature any interesting vocals or melodies whatsoever. And the reason that is is because this track, like many on the radio today, brings pretty much moaning that is supposed to be sold as singing. And the melody on this part seems really half-baked, I just find so many pop songs today where it's like the verse is completely neglected in favor of just having an incredibly explosive chorus. Which is sad, because Charli seems like a capable singer. I don't know why they would want to throw out a verse like this as opposed to something that was a little more well crafted.\r
\r
To be completely honest, there isn't a single song on this album that captivates me until the fourth and fifth tracks on here. “Stay Away” and “Set Me Free”, these tracks to me have solid melodic writing for beginning to end, explosive choruses, sweet verses, production that actually rings through as being very punchy and clear. The instrumentation seems like it's oriented in a really clean interesting way whereas tracks like “Take My Hand” instead just feel like a jumbled mess where Charli and her producers are trying to make as much synthetic noise as possible to make it seem like something interesting is happening, when maybe it's really not the case. The song “Stay Away”, really nice solid breakup song, a track about not wanting to be around someone, because they sort of bring those old emotions back up in you, again, it's torture to see them again. And the track “Feel My Pain” sort of a lust song, not exactly new and refreshing angles in pop music, but still, the singing goes overwhelm, the production feels really synthetic, futuristic and slightly dark.\r

Unfortunately, the album doesn't continue on this great songwriting streak that it sets up with these two tracks. The track “Grins”, the really terrible off-pitch background singing and rap verses on this track make the song nearly unbearable to me. And what's even worse is the track “Cloud Aura”, which features the rapper Brooke Candy. It's one of the few tracks on this album where the writing credits are just sort of written to Charli and her feature spot on the song and it really sounds like it, with an incredibly monotonous lead melody that seems to drone on and on and on, until Brooke and Charli just trade really annoying and underwhelming rap verses. And moments on this album where like I hear Brooke Candy rapping about life in the trap, and Charli referring to getting sexy and addressed with a love interest as gangsta. There are just some points when I want to ignore the lyrics, just so, I don't have a stronger negative reaction to this album. We on some husband-and-wife shit, but I don't care, because I know, I really like it. They're really moments on this album, where these rap verses give me a nervous tic that is so intense, that I'm just begging for more parts with tacky auto-tune.\r
\r
Overall, with “True Romance”, there are a few very good singles on this LP, I will give it that, but many other tracks on this thing feel too much like I'm listening to Rebecca Black go through her goth phase. When I don't get that vibe unfortunately, so many of the terrible rap verses and just trashy auto-tune get in the way of what really could be a good pop song. There are moments where I really do feel like this album is lyrically shallow, like when Charli is moaning over and over and over “how can I fix what I fucked up”. Not exactly poetry, but there are some moments on this album where Charli does come off authentic, because of these sort of conversational words that she works into her verses. I don't doubt that Charli feels sincerely about some of the things that she sings, raps and says on this album. But very rarely do melody, production, lyrics and structure actually come together into a great tune on this album.\r
