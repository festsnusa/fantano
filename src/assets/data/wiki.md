4100 'Formal Growth in the Desert is the sixth studio album by American post-punk band Protomartyr.\n\nSince their 2012 debut, Protomartyr have mastered the art of evoking place: the grinding Midwest humility of their hometown, as well as the x-rayed elucidation of America that comes with their vantage. The group’s sixth album was recorded at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, TX with producer Jake Aron. “The desert is more of a metaphor or symbol,” singer Joe Casey says, “of emotional deserts, or a place or time that seems to lack life.” The “growth” came from a period of colossal transition for Casey, including the death of his mother. But life does go on, and Casey describes the great theme of Formal Growth In The Desert as an embrace and acknowledgment of that fact: a 12-song testament to “getting on with life,” even when it feels impossibly hard. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Protomartyr/Formal+Growth+in+the+Desert">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4098 `FOO FIGHTERS, the Rock And Roll Hall Of Famers' 11th album, "But Here We Are", out June 2 on Roswell/RCA.\n\nA brutally honest and emotionally raw response to everything FOO FIGHTERS endured over the last year, "But Here We Are" is a testament to the healing powers of music, friendship and family.\n\nProduced by Greg Kurstin and FOO FIGHTERS, "But Here We Are" is in nearly equal measure the eleventh FOO FIGHTERS album and the first chapter of the band's new life. Sonically channeling the naiveté of FOO FIGHTERS' 1995 debut, informed by decades of maturity and depth, "But Here We Are" is the sound of brothers finding refuge in the music that brought them together in the first place 28 years ago, a process that was as therapeutic as it was about a continuation of life.\n\n"But Here We Are" track listing:\n\n01.

4088 'Gag Order is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Kesha. It was released on May 19, 2023, by Kemosabe Records and RCA Records. Announced in late April 2023, the album sees the singer as executive producer following her previous two albums. She primarily worked with producer, Rick Rubin, who helped her dive deep into her more vulnerable side to create the project. Other producers include Stuart Crichton, Stint and Drew Pearson.\n\nSonically, the album marks a departure from the electro-pop sound of her previous albums and is instead primarily an experimental, art-pop album with elements of gospel, electronic, and soul music. Kesha stated that she wanted to weave together a variety of genres through a cohesive emotional and artful lens on this record. Lyrically, the album depicts dark and emotional themes on her own personal experiences while working in the music industry. The title of the album is a reference to her legal battles against producer Dr. Luke.\n\nThe album was proceeded by three singles. "Eat the Acid " and "Fine Line " were released on April 28, 2023 as a dual single. The third single, "Only Love Can Save Us Now " was released two days prior to the album on May 17, 2023. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kesha/Gag+Order">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4075 'Maps is the second album from NYC rapper billy woods and LA producer Kenny Segal, their first full collaboration since 2019’s Hiding Places. Four years after that landmark record, the duo have reunited with a vengeance. Maps is a story of the road, or roads, taken and untaken; of living the dream and dreaming of another life. It is an album about trying to find your way home, after making your home wherever you lay your head.\n\n“Kenny and I made more songs together before Hiding Places than we did after,” woods says. “I think we only collaborated once over the last four years and although we didn’t talk about it, I think we wanted to let that energy build again. Neither of us wanted to make Hiding Places 2. We needed to go on other journeys, artistic and otherwise, to come back and do something fresh.”\n\nProduced in full by Kenny Segal, Maps features Danny Brown, ELUCID (Armand Hammer), Shabaka Hutchins, Sam Herring (Future Islands), Quelle Chris, Aesop Rock, jbnjame, Benjamin Booker, and ShrapKnel. Segal moves effortlessly through styles but everything is underpinned with deep basslines and mean drums laid down like railroad tracks. Weaving between poignant memoirs, deadpan humor, and incandescent bursts of surrealism, Maps cements both artists’ place amongst the best of their time.\n\nCREDITS\nAll songs written by billy woods except where noted\nProduced and mixed by Kenny Segal\nEngineered by Kenny Segal, Steel Tipped Dove\nAdditional engineering by Aesop Rock\nMastered by Willie Green @ The Greenhouse\nAaron Carmack - rhodes on 3,17\nAaron Shaw - tenor sax on 12\nJason Wool - piano on 11, rhodes on 16\nJoanne - additional vocals on 15\nMike Parvizi - bass on 17\nRyan Crosby - guitar on 17\nShabaka Hutchings - flute on 10\n\nArt Direction by billy woods\nIllustrations by ashes57\nGraphic Design by ashes57\n\nThanks to ELUCID, Mo Niklz, J.

4073 `if looks could kill is Destroy Lonely’s  follow-up project to his August 2022 mixtape, NO STYLIST.\n\nDestroy Lonely first teased the project on September 15, 2022, in a now-deleted Twitter post, stating:\n\n"next album > “if looks could kill…”\n\nAfter the release of the music videos for “FAKENGGAS” and “NEVEREVER”, fans were already ready for new music from Lone, which prompted him to reveal the supposed release date for the album by stating on Tumblr, “my album comes out in april”.\n\nThis would be followed with the release of the highly-anticipated, self titled song “if looks could kill” on March 3rd, 2023. However, following the release of this single, Destroy Lonely would keep radio silence about new music for the next month or so.\n\nOn April 15th, 2023, after his performance in Rolling Loud Thailand, Destroy Lonely would give fans a hint of when to expect the album by saying “If Looks Could Kill closer than y'all think”, seemingly aiming for a late April release. Lone would confirm that one of the songs he previously previewed, “how u feel?” (at the time titled “Finish Line”) is confirmed to be on the album.\n\nThe rollout for the album would seem to officially start on April 25th, 2023, when fans noticed a “billboard” in New York City with just the words “If Looks Could Kill” written in red on a mirror. The board would also show a QR code on the bottom right, leading fans to his website, revealing a countdown ending for May 5th, the supposed release for the album. Lone would also break his silence from social media, posting on his Instagram story a snippet of “by the pound”.\n\nOn the night of April 25th, Opium labelmate and close friend of Lone, Ken Carson would post pictures with Lone on his Instagram. This was also followed by an Instagram post by Lone himself a few minutes after Ken’s post as well as Destroy Lonely archiving any other posts he had on his page. In the comments of Lone’s post, Ken Carson and Lone would both promote this album, with Lone teasing the song “money & sex”, one of his collaborations with Ken, by commenting “$ & XXX”.\n\nThe official tracklist, as well as cover art, would be revealed through the pre-saves revealed by Destroy Lonely through his Instagram on April 28th, 2023.

4070 `First Two Pages of Frankenstein is the ninth studio album by the American indie rock band the National, and was released on April 28, 2023, by 4AD. The album was produced by The National at Long Pond studio in upstate New York and features guest appearances from Sufjan Stevens, Phoebe Bridgers, and Taylor Swift.\n\nAfter the release of I Am Easy to Find (2019) and the cancellation of The National's touring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the band members retreated from each other. Lead singer and lyricist Matt Berninger released the solo record Serpentine Prison. Bryce Dessner, now living in France, worked on film scores and classical compositions. Aaron Dessner produced two albums by Taylor Swift and recorded the highly collaborative How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last?, the second studio album with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon as part of their side-project Big Red Machine. Bryan and Scott Devendorf assisted other musicians with making their music.\n\nWork on a ninth National album was initially stalled while Berninger navigated "a very dark spot where I couldn't come up with lyrics or melodies at all. Even though we'd always been anxious whenever we were working on a record, this was the first time it ever felt like maybe things really had come to an end." Bryce Dessner said that the band eventually "managed to come back together and approach everything from a different angle, and because of that we arrived at what feels like a new era for the band." According to Aaron Dessner, a turning point came with the lead single "Tropic Morning News", which was co-written with Berninger's wife, Carin Besser, and partly recorded live in Hamburg: "When Matt came in with that song in the depths of his depression, it felt like a turning point for us. It's almost Dylan-esque in its lyrics and it's so much fun to play; everything suddenly felt like it was coming alive again."\n\nThe album was produced by the National at Aaron Dessner's Long Pond studio in Hudson Valley, New York. It features guest vocalists Sufjan Stevens, Phoebe Bridgers and Taylor Swift. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+National/First+Two+Pages+of+Frankenstein">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4064 'The Worm is the second studio album by British band HMLTD. It was released on 7 April 2023 through Lucky Number Music.\n\nCreated over the course of two years with a cast of 47 musicians – including a gospel choir and a 16-piece string orchestra – The Worm is less a concept album than a fully-fledged musical universe, transcending genre and medium. Set in a disorienting anachronistic version of Medieval England – as steeped in dystopian sci-fi fantasy as it is folklore and Old English mythology – it’s part political polemic, part deeply moving psychological journey, and finds frontman Henry Spychalski drawing on his own psycho-spiritual struggles to construct a modern parable about the impotence felt by individuals stuck inside gargantuan, labyrinthine systems of power that they are powerless to change.\n\nHenry explains,“We’re told to believe that anxiety and depression are purely material and biological – like a parasitic worm that can be removed with the right treatment. I think that really these conditions reflect the world that surrounds us - like colonies that a far bigger Worm has made in each of us - the psychological havoc wreaked by our inescapable capitalist reality and the looming apocalypse it has created." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HMLTD/The+Worm">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4057 `Speaking on the concept of the album title, Hetfield says: "72 seasons. The first 18 years of our lives that form our true or false selves. The concept that we were told 'who we are' by our parents. A possible pigeonholing around what kind of personality we are. I think the most interesting part of this is the continued study of those core beliefs and how it affects our perception of the world today. Much of our adult experience is reenactment or reaction to these childhood experiences. Prisoners of childhood or breaking free of those bondages we carry." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/72+Seasons">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4063 '“One Wayne G” is a 199-song collection of demos and unreleased material by popular indie artist Mac DeMarco. It was released digitally on April 21st, 2023 without any announcement. Most songs on this collection are instrumental and ambient with only 18 songs of the 199 having lyrics, and all titles follow a dated format.\n\nThe album starts with “20180512” (May 12th, 2018) and ends with “20230114” (January 14th, 2023). All of these songs were recorded in Mac’s garage studio, with footage of him recording “20190724” (July 24th, 2019) being resurfaced on TikTok. The song "20190724", also known as "Garbage Funk", was publicized during an interview of Mac with PBS.\n\nThe title, One Wayne G, appears to allude to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. On its Instagram stories, Mac’s Record Label posted two photos of Gretzky, one with the text, “There is only One Wayne G.” The collection of demos has 199 tracks, a possible reference to Gretzky famously wearing the number 99.\n\nSome of the titles include extra information beyond the date, such as working titles. The tracks titled with extra numbers represent the number song if multiple tracks were created on the same day. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+DeMarco/One+Wayne+G">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4053 'The latest by Canadian composer Tim Hecker serves as a beacon of unease against the deluge of false positive corporate ambient currently in vogue. Whether taken as warning or promise, No Highs delivers – this is music of austerity and ambiguity, purgatorial and seasick. A jagged anti-relaxant for our medicated age, rough-hewn and undefined.\n\nMorse code pulse programming flickers like distress signals while a gathering storm of strings, noise, and low-end looms in the distance. Processed electronics shiver and shudder against pitch-shifting assemblages of crackling voltage, mantric horns (including exquisite modal sax by Colin Stetson), and cathedral keys. Throughout, the pieces both accrue and avoid drama, more attuned to undertow than crescendo. Hecker mentions “negation” as a muse of sorts – the sense of tumult without bombast, tethered ecstasies, an escape from escapism. His is an antagonism both brusque and beguiling, devoid of resolution, beckoning the listener ever deeper into its greyscale alchemies of magisterial disquiet. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Hecker/No+Highs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4039 `Live at Bush Hall is a concert film by British rock band Black Country, New Road released on 20 February 2023 through YouTube. It is the first full-length release since Ants From Up There and the departure of Isaac Wood, the band's vocalist. It consists of recordings from previously unreleased music performed live at Bush Hall, London, over the period of 15-16 December 2022.\n\nOn 31 January 2022, four days prior to the release of Ants From Up There, Black Country, New Road's vocalist, Isaac Wood announced that he was departing the band for mental health reasons. This resulted in the band canceling their upcoming tour in North America and beginning work on new music they could perform without him. They continued to perform gigs as they felt they had to "keep momentum," or it would have "felt like  were quitting music". Over the following months, the band wrote new music with the specific intent to be performed live, as they did not want to create a new full-length album at the time. Lewis Evans, who was acting as the band's saxophonist and as one of the vocalists, said that they wanted to release a live performance to act as a "little time capsule of these eight months that we’ve had playing these songs on the road". Luke Mark, the guitarist, wanted to avoid the recording appearing disingenuous by making the cuts between performances prominent, rather than attempting to disguise them.\n\nTo accomplish this, the band constructed a unique theme for each of the three live sessions: "When The Whistle Thins", which was farming themed; "I Ain't Alfredo No Ghosts", pizza and restaurant themed; and "The Taming Of The School", 1980s prom night themed. Combined, this resulted in obvious cuts between songs, showing that they "didn't want to just do this completely perfect thing" according to Evans. According to drummer Charlie Wayne, they wanted the "focal point to be this film. We've put a lot of effort into making it feel like you're watching a live gig. It's not an album in our eyes, it's a live performance."\n\nBlack Country, New Road posted a short teaser on their social media for something "coming soon," scheduled for release on 20 February. It was then announced to be a recording of their performances at Bush Hall, London, premiering on YouTube. There was also a special screening on the same night of the release at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.\n\nA CD of the performance is due for release on 24 March 2023 through Ninja Tune. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Country,+New+Road/Live+At+Bush+Hall">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4025 'This is a record of halves. \n\nAngela Seo sings on half of the record. Jamie Stewart sings on half of the record. \n\nHalf of the songs are experimental industrial. Half of the songs are experimental modern classical. \n\nHalf of it is real. Half of it is imaginary. \n\nThe real songs attempt to turn the worst life has offered to five people the band is connected with into some kind of desperate shape that does something, anything, other than grind and brutalize their hearts and memory within these stunningly horrendous experiences. \n\nThe imaginary songs are an expansion and abstract exploration of the early rock and roll “Teen Tragedy” genre as jumping off point to decontaminate the band’s own overwhelming emotions in knowing and living with what has happened to these five people. \n\nWhat none of this record does and despite the oft repeated assertion, what Xiu Xiu has never done, is attempt to superficially shock the listener. Instead, Xiu Xiu has spent twenty years grappling with how to process, to be empathetic towards, to disobey and to reorganize horror; there is no other word for it other than horror. \n\nThe motivation for writing Ignore Grief to be about a child who was sold into prostitution by his mother, a junior high student who was kidnapped and murdered, incessantly choosing alcohol and cocaine over one’s family, becoming lost in the bleakest, darkest aspects of cultish spirituality and committing suicide as means to escape and protest a life of violent sex work is because the members of Xiu Xiu themselves are deeply shocked. \n\nOld friend and new member David Kendrick (Sparks, Devo, Gleaming Spires) joins Angela Seo and Jamie Stewart through whatever this may be and whatever it may mean and why ever it may have occurred. The point of aesthetic examination is to see if there is any way to come out the other side or if there is even any reason. In either case there may not be but to simply turn away would be yet a further act of destruction. \n\n“I had now lost all confidence in myself, doubted all men immeasurably, and abandoned all hopes for the things of this world, all joy, all sympathy, eternally. This was the truly decisive incident of my life. I had been split through the forehead between the eyebrows, a wound that was to throb with pain whenever I came into contact with a human being.” \n-Osamu Dazai <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Xiu+Xiu/Ignore+Grief">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at three different studios: Out of the Blue Music Studios in Leith; Narcissus Studio in London; and Northwind in Durban, South Africa.\n\n"Sink or Swim" features a sample replay produced by Richard Adlam and Hal Ritson for Replay Heaven.\n\nOn 12 July 2022, the band released the single "Geronimo", their first new music in four years. The album was officially announced on 20 October 2022, alongside a second single "I Saw" and a music video directed by Austrian-Nigerian artist David Uzochukwu. A third single, "Tell Somebody", was released on 6 December 2022 with another Uzochukwu-directed music video. "Rice", the fourth and final single, was released on 9 January 2023, also with a Uzochukwu-directed visual.\n\nHeavy Heavy was met with critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 17 reviews.\n\nAnthony Boire of Exclaim! gave the album an 8 out 10 rating, writing, "Heavy Heavy may be a little too sweet for long-time listeners, but its massive choruses, strong hooks and ecstatic sound too timely and too powerful to deny." Loud and Quiet Mag gave the album 9/10, calling it "a brilliant return from a gold-standard band in UK music". The Scotsman gave the album 4/5, writing Heavy Heavy "is delivered with mic-drop confidence, encased in another striking sleeve, redolent of partying with claws out".\n\nReviewing the album for AllMusic, Andy Kellman noted that, "Heavy Heavy pulls in the listener with an empathetic lust for life that, whether brimming with optimism, steeling for a threat to survival, or reckoning with a perceived futility of existence, somehow never wavers." For DIY Magazine, Sean Kerwick described it as, " Unique, raw and totally joyous." In the review for NME, Dhruva Balram declared that, "Heavy Heavy is a passionate, soulful and often mesmerising work that will stick around long past the first listen. Succinct and underpinned by a catchy melodic structure, it continues Young Fathers’ peerless run of singular albums and further cements them as one of the more unique acts to exist today."\n\nWriting for Pitchfork, Will Pritchard stated that, "Heavy Heavy sweeps its listener along, churchlike, and conveys the feeling that resisting the urge will always feel worse than rising up and pushing the air from your lungs. And then, after a brief 10 tracks, it's all over—as if the procession has marched on, out of earshot. But the invite is still there extended: It's up to you whether to accept it or not." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Fathers/Heavy+Heavy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, Michelle Dalarossa from Under the Radar was more critical of the album, stating "Unfortunately, the combination of Christmas kitsch and Weezer kitsch makes for a grating mishmash of tackiness, angst, and blown-out fuzz that ultimately falls flat."

3979 `Since I Left You is the debut studio album by Australian electronic dance music group The Avalanches, which was released on 27 November 2000. Produced by The Avalanches' members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler), it was issued on Modular Recordings. The album was created in two separate near-identical studios by Chater and Seltmann, passing audio mixes of records they sampled. The album contains about 3500 vinyl samples of various genres of music. As it was not originally intended for international release, the duo did not worry about copyright restrictions nor attempt to keep track of which samples they would need to clear.\n\nAfter the album's positive reception in Australia, the duo considered an international release – its date was held back until 2001 in both the United Kingdom and North America and appeared in slightly altered forms. The delay and changes occurred so that the group could obtain permission to use the samples or use replacements. Five singles were spawned by the album, "Electricity", "Frontier Psychiatrist", "Since I Left You", "Radio" and "A Different Feeling". The group promoted the album by organising headlining tours in Australia, Europe and the United States. Since I Left You was issued to favourable reception, it peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart, number 12 in Norway, number eight on the UK Album Charts and, in the United States, at number ten on the Top Electronic Albums chart and in the top 40 on the Top Heatseekers chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 it won in three categories: Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Dance Release, Producer of the Year for Bobbydazzler. The Avalanches won a fourth award, Breakthrough Artist – Single for "Frontier Psychiatrist". Since I Left You became one of the best reviewed albums of the 2000s. In October 2010, it was listed at No. 10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avalanches/Since+I+Left+You">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After releasing their September 1985 single, "The Boy with the Thorn in His Side" (which is included on "The Queen Is Dead" in an updated, slightly re-mixed version), The Smiths turned to recording their third album. Marr produced the album with singer Morrissey, and worked with engineer Stephen Street, who had assumed the same role on the band's previous album "Meat Is Murder". Street recalled, "Morrissey, Johnny and I had a really good working relationship — we were all roughly the same age and into the same kind of things, so everyone felt quite relaxed in the studio".\n\nAt the time the group was having difficulty with their label Rough Trade, which Street characterised as "Rough Trade and EMI trying to sign up everything". Street noted, "But this didn't get in the way of recording because the atmosphere in the studio was very, very constructive." The group recorded "Bigmouth Strikes Again" and "Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others" at RAK Studios in northwest London. After a brief tour, the group recorded and mixed the majority of the album at Jacobs Studios in Farnham, Surrey, during late 1985 and early 1986.\n\nThe album's title comes from the name of a chapter of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s cult classic novel "Last Exit to Brooklyn".\n\n"The Queen Is Dead" finally emerged half a year later, in June 1986, and was previewed by the May single release of "Bigmouth Strikes Again", strictly speaking the only single taken from the album. Many encouraged the band to release "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" as a single, but Johnny Marr is said to have wanted an explosive, searing single, along the lines of The Rolling Stones' "Jumpin' Jack Flash", to announce that The Smiths had returned from hiatus. It did not fare as well as expected, stalling at number 26 on the British charts.\n\nThe album is popularly regarded as The Smiths' best album. With its unique blend of musical styles (including jangle pop, British Invasion, music hall, rockabilly and punk rock), it quickly became a British sensation and established The Smiths as one of the biggest bands of their era. Both Morrissey and Marr disagree, however, citing its 1987 successor (and unexpectedly final Smiths LP), "Strangeways, Here We Come", as their peak.\n\nRolling Stone gave the album a five star rating. Reviewer Mark Coleman remarked on Morrissey's sense of humour and singled out the singer's performance on "Cemetry Gates" as a highlight. Coleman concluded, "Like it or not, this guy's going to be around for a while." Pitchfork Media ranked the album as the sixth best of the 1980s. In 2000, Mojo magazine placed "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" at number 25 on their list of the 100 greatest songs of all time, while VH2 placed it top of their Top 500 Indie Songs chart. In 2003, "The Queen Is Dead" was ranked number 216 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time. In 2006 it was named the second greatest British album of all time by NME. In 2006, Q Magazine placed the album at #3 in its list of "40 Best Albums of the '80s".\n\nThe song "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out", was a contender for lead single off the album, but was passed over in favour of "Bigmouth Strikes Again". (Later in 1986 it was released as a 7"-only single in France). It received a belated release in 1992, when it became one of WEA's singles in a programme to promote Smiths re-releases \n\n"Cemetry Gates" was Morrissey's direct response to critics who had cried foul over his use of texts written by some of his favorite authors, notably Shelagh Delaney and Elizabeth Smart. Oscar Wilde, who was also accused of plagiarism, figures as a patron saint of Morrissey's in the song's lyrics. A Wilde quote, "Talent borrows, genius steals", was etched in the vinyl run-out grooves of the first single off the album, "Bigmouth Strikes Again". "Cemetry Gates" also has interesting reverberations with fellow English writer Evelyn Waugh's 1948 novel The Loved One, much of which takes place in a cemetery. The novel's main character Dennis Barlow plagiarizes poems by various English poets in his overtures to Aimee Thanatogenos.\n\n"The Queen Is Dead", which leads off the album and notably became an expressionistic music video directed by Derek Jarman, starts with a soundbite from Bryan Forbes' 1962 British film The L-Shaped Room. Another instance of Morrissey's fascination with '60s British cinema, the film featured performances by Pat Phoenix (who had already appeared as a cover star on the 1985 single "Shakespeare's Sister") and Cicely Courtneidge as an elderly lesbian veteran of the music halls. The soundbite is Courtneidge's character nostalgically singing the World War I song "Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty". The actress had also appeared in a gala performance for Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee called "God Save the Queen", and died in 1980.\n\nA few songs, including "The Queen Is Dead" and "Bigmouth Strikes Again", feature pitch-shifted backing vocals by Morrissey. Morrissey liked to experiment with effects on his voice, so Street ran his voice through a harmoniser for the backing tracks. Street recalled, "At that time, apart from the harmoniser, he didn't go for much backing vocal or harmony work — he's done that more on recent albums — but he did like to experiment". The backing vocals are attributed to "Ann Coates" on the record sleeve (Ancoats is a district in Manchester, just North East of the city centre).\n\nThe album cover of "The Queen Is Dead", designed by Morrissey, features Alain Delon from the 1964 film "L'Insoumis". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/The+Queen+Is+Dead">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3975 `"E. 1999 Eternal" is the critically acclaimed second studio album by hip-hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, released July 25, 1995 on Ruthless Records. Following up on the surprise success of their breakthrough single, "Thuggish Ruggish Bone," E. 1999 Eternal became a popular album that received substantial critical acclaim for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's unique melodic style of rapping.\n\n"E. 1999 Eternal" remains the group's best-selling album, with four million copies sold in the United States and ten million worldwide.

3966 `SOS is the second studio album by American singer SZA, released on December 9, 2022, via Top Dawg Entertainment and RCA Records. The album features guest appearances from Don Toliver, Phoebe Bridgers, Travis Scott, and the late Ol' Dirty Bastard.\n\nSOS is primarily an R&B album with influences from hip hop and pop. The album samples sound references from soul, gospel, jazz and melodic rap. The sound of the album was described as "a varied palette", combining "surf rock" and "grunge" elements, alongside "her beloved lo-fi beats". In Complex, she described the album's sound: "I have no idea what it sounds like to anybody else. I really don't know. It's so bizarre. It's weird that I can't put my finger on it. It's a little bit of everything." She added that some parts of the song had an "aggressive" sound whereas others were soft or balladic. During the Rolling Stone interview, she and Punch spoke in length about the album's composition. The inspiration in question was eclectic, drawing from jazz, alternative rock, "traditional" R&B, country, and hip hop. About the wide range of genres incorporated into the album, SZA said she did not care if her production choices made the album sound incohesive, because to her, "if you sound like you, your shit’s going to be cohesive. Period." Punch commented: "It's a new chapter. She's not scared to try certain things now."\n\nSOS has received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the album received a score of 90 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/SZA/SOS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3951 '‘HOSTILE ARCHITECTURE is a sonic exploration of the ways that subjects under late capitalism are constrained and set in motion via the various structures that uphold stratification and oppression in urban contexts. It is inspired by brutalist, postmodern and utilitarian architectural structures that are found throughout post-industrial cities, hauntological in nature, being designed to provide for the populace through affordable housing but ultimately cost-cutting exercises and unfit for purpose. The term hostile architecture refers to design elements in social spaces that deter the public from using the object for means unintended by the designer, e.g. anti-homeless spikes, which the album presents as emblematic of a foundational contempt for the poor and working class, an exemplification of a status quo fortified in concrete. The album invites the listener to explore the dissonance of these contradictions in their own circumstances and perhaps consider possibilities for a world beyond what Mark Fisher called “Capitalist Realism.”’\nTragic Heroin Video: youtu.be/XBNY-l3NT9s\ncredits\nreleased July 18, 2022\n\nPerformers:\nAlasdair Dunn (Voice, Drums)\nFraser Gordon (Guitars, Voice)\nBen Brown (FALLOCH/BARSHASKETH, Bass)\nJames Johnson (Violin, Voice)\nMatthew Johnson (Saxophone, Voice)\nScott McLean (FALLOCH, Rhodes, Prepared Piano)\nRylan Gleave (ALL MEN UNTO ME, T/B Voice)\nAmaya López-Carromero (MAUD THE MOTH, S/A Voice)\nOtrebor (BOTANIST, Hammered Dulcimer)\nProduction, Recording and Mixing Scott McLean at La Chunky Studios, Glasgow.\nMastering Brad Boatright, Audiosiege Engineering\nArt and Layout Tobias Holmbeck <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ashenspire/Hostile+Architecture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3947 `I Didn't Mean to Haunt You is the third studio album by American rapper and singer-songwriter Quadeca. It was released on November 10, 2022, through deadAir and AWAL. The album serves as a direct follow-up to his previous studio album From Me to You, and follows the story of a deceased muse, presumably a fictionalized version of Quadeca, experiencing limbo as a ghost after suicide by hanging. This concept was supported while working on the album by 16 hour studio sessions and losing 40 pounds "to feel more ghostly."The album was released alongside a visual album on YouTube.\n\nWhile lacking mainstream appeal, Quadeca managed to win the hearts of hardcore music fans with the album plateauing as the 5th best album of 2022 by user score on AOTY.org, impressively beating out Kendrick Lamar's Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers in the process. In just a year, Quadeca had managed to innovate his self-production by tenfold, with his ambition taking him to Abbey Road Studios for mastering. The album contains features from eminent experimental hip-hop artist Danny Brown, Kanye's Sunday Service Choir, and former Swans percussionist Thor Harris. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Quadeca/i+didn%27t+mean+to+haunt+you">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3929 `Midnights is the tenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 21, 2022, through Republic Records. Announced at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, the album marks Swift's first body of new work since her ninth studio album, evermore. Swift wrote and produced Midnights with Jack Antonoff and described the album as a "journey through terrors and sweet dreams" that describes thirteen sleepless nights of her life.\n\nFollowing the surprise release and negligible promotion of her previous studio albums, Swift returned to her traditional album roll-out with Midnights. She unveiled the track list through a TikTok series called 'Midnights Mayhem with Me' from September 21 to October 7, 2022. The fourth track, "Snow on the Beach", features Lana Del Rey.\n\nSwift adopted a glamorous aesthetic for Midnights that drew from 1970s fashion. A trailer teasing several visuals for the album was released on October 20. A music video for the third track, "Anti-Hero", was premiered on October 21, 2022.\n\nThe standard edition of Midnights consists of thirteen tracks. The deluxe CD adds three bonus songs, of which two are remixes, while Midnights (3am Edition), made available exclusively on streaming platforms and for digital download, adds seven other bonus tracks. Six of the album's tracks are labeled explicit. Del Rey provides guest vocals on the fourth track, "Snow on the Beach".\n\nMidnights was met with widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised its restrained production, candid songwriting, and vocal cadences. The album was also a major commercial success across all formats of music consumption; it broke the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for an album, and became the fastest-selling album in the United States since Swift's own reputation, finishing its first day as the best-selling album of 2022 and logging the largest vinyl sales week of the 21st century, marked Swift's 11th number-one album on the Billboard 200, and spawned 10 top-ten songs on the Hot 100 "the most for any album" in the same week. To support Midnights, Swift will embark on the Eras Tour in 2023.\n\nBillboard called Swift's unexpected announcement of the album at the Video Music Awards a "headline-grabbing" moment. Bruce Gillmer, the show's producer, stated that Midnights gave a "massive lift" to the viewership ratings. The album's cover artwork became an internet trend, mimicked and parodied by social media users, including official accounts of brands, organizations and celebrities. Apple Fitness+ released three exercise programs designed around Swift's music, featuring tracks from Midnights, curated for yoga, treadmill and HITT workouts. Spotify's servers crashed for several minutes when the album was released.\n\nThe commercial success of Midnights across all formats was unprecedented in the streaming era. Financial Times pondered whether Swift is "the last pop superstar", underscoring the 1.5 million first-week units—a figure unseen since the "1990s boy bands" era, which was regarded as the peak for the US music business. Music publisher Matt Pincus called Swift "basically an intellectual property franchise now. Like a DC movie". Fortune compared her to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Noting a 2021 article from The New York Times that asked "if Adele couldn't sell more than a million albums in a single week, could any artist?" after her album 30 missed the mark, Rolling Stone responded that Swift "has once again moved the goalposts regarding what the music industry can see as possible from a major pop star". Slate underscored how Swift's career has lasted longer than that of the Beatles, and broke the band's once-deemed "unbeatable" records. Business journalist Greg Jericho, in The Guardian, lauded her ability to remain culturally relevant and successful 18 years into her music career, highlighting how the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen were past their prime at that stage. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/Midnights">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3928 `The Car is the seventh studio album by English rock band Arctic Monkeys, released on 21 October 2022 by Domino Recording Company. It was written by band frontman Alex Turner in his Los Angeles home. It was produced in Suffolk, Paris and London by frequent Arctic Monkeys collaborator James Ford, alongside frequent guest musicians Tom Rowley, Loren Humphrey and Tyler Parkford. It was arranged by Bridget Samuels and Turner. Drummer Matt Helders took the picture on the album cover, which depicts a white car in an empty car park. Its title refers to said cover and the abundance of references to vehicles in the lyrics.\n\nThe Car builds upon the sound from the band's previous album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino (2018). It features a wide array of genres that include orchestral rock, lounge pop, baroque pop, and funk, as well as elements of jazz. It also draws influence from soul music, electronic music, glam rock, bossa nova, traditional pop and vintage film soundtracks.\n\nThe album received critical acclaim upon its release. Critics complimented the band's artistic progression, the album's production and Turner's lyrics, though some felt the continued deviation from the band's earlier indie rock sound would prove as polarizing. On the charts, The Car debuted at number two in ten territories, including the United Kingdom, blocked from the top spot by Taylor Swift's Midnights. It became Arctic Monkeys' first album to not reach the top spot of the UK Albums Chart. The album was promoted by the singles "There'd Better Be a Mirrorball", "Body Paint" and "I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/The+Car">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The sessions marked the return of guitarist John Frusciante after a ten-year absence, and resulted in fifty songs being recorded with producer Rick Rubin and recording engineer Ryan Hewitt.\n\nReflecting on the wealth of material that the band recorded, drummer Chad Smith noted: "We just wrote a bunch of music and wrote and wrote with no time constraints and ended up recording all these songs. We always record more than what comes out on a record, but often they get left in the vault or unfinished or whatever. But we finished them all. We just felt like we had too many good songs to not put out another record. It’s not like a b-sides record or anything like that. Everything felt good and right."\n\nThe band announced the album during their Global Stadium Tour on July 23, 2022 at their show in Denver with pre-sales of the album being made available which included various versions of the album on limited edition vinyl.\n\nThe album's first single, "Tippa My Tongue", was released alongside a music video on August 19, 2022. A second song from the album, "Eddie", which was inspired by musician Eddie Van Halen, was released on September 23, 2022.\n\nThe band sequenced both Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen to become distinct listening experiences from one another: "We thought, 'These  go together here and these go together there and, look, we’ve got two things, both great.'" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Return+of+the+Dream+Canteen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3910 `Fossora is the tenth studio album by Icelandic singer-musician Björk. It was officially released on September 30, 2022 through One Little Independent Records.\n\nThe word 'fossora' derives from Latin meaning “hole digger”, representing Björk’s intent to dig up and re-discover her roots, giving them new meanings. Some of the album’s themes are indeed Björk’s family, her home country Iceland, love, and the idea of belonging to a place. Björk worked on the album during her stay in Iceland over the course of 5 years, and the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine/lockdown helped her to cement her vision.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian it was revealed that the album would feature her son Sindri, her daughter Ísadóra (aka Doa), the singer-songwriter serpentwithfeet, and contributions from the Indonesian dance duo Gabber Modus Operandi. Sonically the album was described as “organic and spacious, earthbound” with a recurring sextet of bass clarinet and “violent outbursts” of gabber. The album also includes two songs written for Björk’s late mother, the environmental activist Hildur Rúna Hauksdóttir, who passed away in 2018.\n\nThe album's title is the ungrammatical feminine version of the Latin word for "digger". The album was partially inspired by the 2018 death of Björk's mother, Hildur Rúna Hauksdóttir, particularly the songs "Sorrowful Soil" and "Ancestress". The songs were written during and after the COVID-19 lockdowns, during which Björk returned to her home country, not having "been that much home since I was 16." The album features contributions from American singer Serpentwithfeet, Björk's two children Sindri and Ísadóra, Indonesian dance duo Gabber Modus Operandi, and bass clarinet sextet Murmuri.\n\nThe artwork for the album was shot by Vidar Logi on August 31, 2022 and revealed along with the tracklist and release date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Fossora">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3906 'FLAWLESS LIKE ME is the long-awaited sophomore studio album by LUCKI, trailing after his December 2021 collaborative project WAKE UP LUCKI, with Working on Dying-producer F1LTHY.\n\nThe first mention of the album dates back to December 10, 2018, in a tweet that aptly read “Flawless like me.” Nothing substantial ever stood out about the tweet until it was implied to be a part of a three-album release after his mixtape Days B4 III. \n\nFalling behind time, the album didn’t meet expectations to be conceived in 2019. The album however wasn’t entirely scrapped by LUCKI himself, instead claiming that the project would be coming “soon” on January 15, 2020. To the surprise of no one, the album was pushed back again for the extended play Almost There. LUCKI commented on the state of FLAWLESS LIKE ME, where he stated:\n\nMay 30th 10 song EP “Almost There/As…” – “Flawless Like Me” the album RIGHT after that."\n\nIn LUCKI’s Instagram live session on September 8, 2022, he would speak more on the album, revealing the September 23 release date.\n\nAfter the FLAWLESS LIKE ME’s cover art leaked on September 17, 2022, LUCKI would confirm the leak’s validity and post a higher quality cover later that same day, alongside outtakes of the cover’s photoshoot.\n\nOn the morning of September 19, 2022, the second lead single “GEEKED N BLESSED” would release along with the 24-track album preview on Apple Music. The tracklist featured the two bonus tracks “Y NOT?” and “Super Urus,” which were released earlier this year as loose singles prior to the release.

3898 `The Mars Volta is the seventh studio album by American progressive rock band the Mars Volta, released through Clouds Hill on September 16, 2022. Produced by guitarist, songwriter and musical director Omar Rodríguez-López, the album was preceded by the singles "Blacklight Shine", "Graveyard Love" and "Vigil".\n\nSelf-titled to mark a "clean slate" in the band's history, it is the band's first studio album in over ten years, following their 2012 album, Noctourniquet, and subsequent break-up. After reuniting in secret in 2019, band leaders Rodríguez-López and Cedric Bixler-Zavala made a conscious effort to break from their previous progressive rock sound and record a pop-influenced album, with Bixler-Zavala directly addressing his family's recent struggles with the Church of Scientology in his lyrics.\n\nThe band will tour North America from September 2022 in support of the record.\n\nBackground\nIn late 2012, following the release of the Mars Volta's sixth studio album, Noctourniquet, core members Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals) and Omar Rodríguez-López (guitar, production) disbanded the group after a falling out between the pair. Writing on his personal Twitter account in early 2013, Bixler-Zavala stated: "I can’t sit here and pretend any more. I no longer am a member of Mars Volta. For the record I tried my hardest to get a full scale North American tour going for Noctourniquet but Omar did not want to." Reflecting on this in 2022, Bixler-Zavala noted: "I was in a really impatient place when I left the band, very immaturely, in a loud way on social media. It was just sort of being a brat." At this time, Bixler-Zavala had joined the Church of Scientology, creating tension between himself and Rodríguez-López and resulting in the pair growing apart.\n\nWithin two years of the falling-out, the pair had reconciled, subsequently forming the supergroup Antemasque and working on the At the Drive-In album, In•ter a•li•a (2017), before regrouping as the Mars Volta in secret in 2019. Remarking on the differences between At the Drive-In and the Mars Volta, Rodríguez-López noted: "The At the Drive-In thing was a very finite thing. It was partly nostalgia and the past, and where we come from and our roots. There’s a certain expectation and a certain thing that you have to give there, and the parameters are very much set. With the Mars Volta, it always goes back to the idea of, ‘Is it exciting, does it move me? Is what I’m hearing coming back out of the speakers just something that makes me dance?’"\n\nA press release for the album stated that the album contains only "two tracks longer than four minutes", marking a shift away from the band's progressive rock sound and into sonic territory marked by "more subtle touches and Caribbean rhythms". The same press release also read that the band are at their "most mature, most concise, most focused" on the album.\n\nRecording\nUpon reuniting the Mars Volta in secret in 2019, Rodríguez-López made a conscious decision not to return to the band's progressive rock sound on any new recordings. This was, in part, influenced by his and Bixler-Zavala's continued work with At the Drive-In between 2016 and 2018: "Being on tour with At the Drive-In for three years, playing way faster than we even do in Mars Volta and more aggressively, you know, it's all the same frequencies, right? Two guitars, the cymbals and Cedric's voice are all in the same frequency, fighting all night long, every day. With the exhaustion of the tour, I just started making tracks, and as I was saturated with this other thing, I wanted to do something else. For me, the most exciting new direction is something we haven't done: to cut things down, to do our version of pop."\n\nThe majority of Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López's collaborations were recorded over a ten-day period, at a Los Angeles house that Rodríguez-López had rented. Rodríguez-López arrived at the sessions with up to 48 song ideas, with Bixler-Zavala writing and recording quickly to the material he responded to the most. Rodríguez-López noted: "I'm just looking for whatever he reacts to naturally. Those things stay true to the end."\n\nWriting and composition\nWriting melodies in keeping with guitarist and musical director Rodríguez-López's pop-based aesthetic, vocalist and lyricist Bixler-Zavala was influenced by David Bowie, Phill Collins, Peter Gabriel and Paul Weller, whose careers often transitioned from experimental work to mainstream success: "I'm looking for that gray area where it's just starting to be pop, but their old selves are still there."  On Weller's influence in particular, Bixler-Zavala described The Mars Volta as the band's "Style Council moment", referring to Weller's decision to pivot genres following the break-up of The Jam: "Quite frankly, a lot of (fans of The Jam) needed to have the Style Council put in front of them, just to show them that you can't be stuck in a genre. It becomes cosplay after a certain time, people start dressing like you, the cover bands come out, the bands who don't understand influence and just make carbon copies then start being praised. You have to reinvent shit, and embrace things your fans didn't think you would embrace."\n\nBixler-Zavala's lyrics were directly influenced by his wife Chrissie Carnell Bixler's legal battles with the actor Danny Masterson and the Church of Scientology, with Carnell Bixler and three other women accusing Masterson of rape and the Church of Scientology with "stalking, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress". In fear of repercussions and tampering by the Church of Scientology, Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López sent their in-progress songs to one another via CDs rather than using cloud storage.\n\nAs a result of the personal subject matter and overall shift in musical style, Bixler-Zavala consciously wrote lyrics that were less cryptic than the band's previous material: "In these songs, there are more direct expressions of what you're supposed to be feeling. On a lot of other Mars Volta records, you'll have that every once in a while. But more often you'll have this total sci-fi riddle. Now I'm speaking about just the things that are happening."\n\nPrior to the release of the band's 2009 album, Octahedron, both Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala suggested that that album was their first "pop" release, with Bixler-Zavala noting at the time: "We wanted to make the opposite of all the records we've done. All along we've threatened people that we'd make a pop record, and now we have." Reflecting on what they considered "pop" at that time and his resistance to writing songs within the genre, Bixler-Zavala noted: "At the time I couldn't have that conversation, because I was so stuck in whatever sort of genre where we were pigeonholed as. I was so comfortable, and I was so used to making very long songs and having them be labyrinth-like and all that kind of stuff. And I just couldn't get my head around it." Rodríguez-López elaborated: "We've been warning you guys, we were saying ten years ago that the most revolutionary thing we could do was make a pop record. We're in our mid-to-late 40s and you can't just still be doing the same shit, expecting to wear an old t-shirt that doesn't fit any more."\n\nRodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala self-titled the album to give them a "clean slate" from their past work as the Mars Volta. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mars+Volta/The+Mars+Volta">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3872 'Although Panda Bear and Sonic Boom are no strangers to each other’s music, Reset marks their first collaborative release. When Sonic Boom pitched an idea to take their working relationship to the next level, he reckoned Panda Bear might reject the proposition outright—in the nine gloriously, feverishly hook-bound tracks of Reset, though, you can hear exactly how much he loved the prospect.\n\nSonic Boom’s notion was simple enough: After lugging his records to Portugal years ago, his fascination was renewed by old favorites and standards he had not heard in years. Something struck him, the way the ornate intros by Eddie Cochran or the Everly Brothers felt largely like stage curtains, compelling in their own right even if they had very little to do with the hits that followed. Sonic Boom began crafting loops from these preambles, twisting and bending the parts like scrap metal before sending them onto Panda Bear.\n\nThe kernel of Reset emerged not long after international lockdowns began. If making it supplied temporary medicine for the duo, it is now permanently so for the rest of us, a reminder that sometimes playing and singing along to old favorites with friends can be enough to make the world feel a bit better. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Panda+Bear/Reset">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is her first solo studio release since Lemonade and serves as the first installment of a trilogy project. Beam, Grace Jones and Tems appear as guest vocalists.\n\nBeyoncé conceived and recorded Renaissance during the COVID-19 pandemic, seeking to inspire joy and escapism in listeners who had experienced isolation and to celebrate a club era in which marginalized people sought liberation through dance music. With its songs seamlessly arranged like a DJ mix, the album blends post-1970s Black dance music styles such as disco and house and pays homage to the Black and queer pioneers of those genres. The album's lyrical content explores themes of escapism, hedonism, self-assurance and self-expression.\n\nRenaissance was a commercial success. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, Beyoncé's seventh consecutive album to do so, and is certified platinum. The platinum-certified lead single "Break My Soul" was released on June 20, 2022, and reached number one on several charts worldwide, including the US Billboard Hot 100. The album's second single "Cuff It" peaked in the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and internationally.\n\nThe album received universal acclaim from music critics for its eclectic yet cohesive sound, joyous mood, and Beyoncé's vocal performance. It became the best-rated album of 2022, named the best album of the year by publications such as the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, NPR, Pitchfork, and Rolling Stone. Renaissance and its songs garnered nine nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year) and won four awards, including Best Dance/Electronic Album, making Beyoncé the most awarded person in the Grammy Awards history.

3851 `Gemini Rights is Steve Lacy’s second studio album, and fourth project overall, following his 2020 album The Lo-Fis. It was released on July 15, 2022, by RCA Records.\n\nSteve Lacy first announced the album on Instagram on February 18, 2022. Three singles were released to support the album: “Mercury”, ”Bad Habits, and “Sunshine,” in that order.\n\n“I want to love unconditionally now...Someone asked me if I felt pressure to make something that people might like. I felt a disconnect, my eyes squinted as I looked up. As I thought about the question, I realized that we always force a separation between the artist (me) and audience (people). But I am not separate. I am people, I just happen to be an artist. Once I understood this, the album felt very easy and fun to make. Gemini Rights is me getting closer to what makes me a part of all things, and that is: feelings. Feelings seem like the only real things sometimes.“\n\n“I write about my anger, sadness, longing, confusion, happiness, horniness, anger, happiness, confusion, fear, etc., all out of love and all laughable, too. The biggest lesson I learned at the end of this album process was how small we make love. I want to love unconditionally now. I will make love bigger, not smaller. To me, Gemini Rights is a step in the right direction. I’m excited for you to have this album as your own as it is no longer mine. Peace.” — Steve Lacy\n\nApple Music features animated artwork for this release.\n\nThe album includes guest appearances from Fousheé, and Lacy's The Internet bandmate, keyboardist Matt Martians. Incorporating a variety of genres, the album has been described as an amalgamation of indie rock and alternative R&B, with elements of funk, jazz, and psychedelia.\n\nGemini Rights received positive reception from music critics upon its release. The album reached the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart, and topped the Top Rock Albums chart.\n\nLacy produced "about 90% of the record" and came up with the title while "tipsy" at a bar, also telling Zane Lowe that he wanted Gemini Rights to be concise so listeners could "make a decision to want to keep playing it again". Lacy shared that the album is a collective story of him “coming into  after a breakup.” He hoped the album is left to be interpreted by people “ they want to.” Gemini Rights is an album that amplifies the artist’s “majestic mystique” discography, leading Lacy to hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks straight, months following the summer release date in 2022. Gemini Rights is an album that Steve Lacy hopes “will make people feel more unconditional love for one another.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Lacy/Gemini+Rights">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3852 `"Hellfire" is the third studio album by English rock/post-punk band black midi, released on 15 July 2022 through Rough Trade Records. Produced by Marta Salogni, who had previously worked with the band in recording the song "John L" from their second studio album, the album was preceded by the singles "Welcome to Hell", "Eat Men Eat", and “Sugar/Tzu”.\n\n"Hellfire" was written while the band was isolating in London, with singer Geordie Greep calling "Hellfire" "an epic action film  if "Cavalcade" was a drama". He described the characters depicted in the album as being "scumbag. Almost everything I write is from a true thing, something I experienced and exaggerated and wrote down. I don't believe in Hell, but all that old world folly is great for songs."\n\nWritten during the COVID-19 pandemic, the band debuted the majority of the "Hellfire" songs during their 2021–2022 tour in support of "Cavalcade". The bulk of the album was recorded in thirteen days, with additional members Kaidi Akinnibi (saxophone) and Seth Evans (keyboards) contributing to the recording process.\n\nMusically, "25 Years Later" labeled "Hellfire" an experimental rock album, with Beats Per Minute describing the album's sound as primarily comprising progressive rock, jazz fusion, and post-punk. Exclaim! saw black midi become jazz-rockers for "Hellfire", while DIY noted their use of art rock's pacing and precision. Alongside their prog stylings, cabaret, country, flamenco, and show tunes influences appear.\n\nDuring the band's 2022 tour, shirts saying "Welcome to Hell" were sold with the date of 15 July 2022 hidden in a phone number. Many previously unreleased songs from "Hellfire" were performed by the band on the tour. The first week of May the band posted teaser clips and a Tetris-like browser game, featuring a MIDI version of their song "Welcome to Hell". On 9 May, the band revealed their third studio album and released the song as a single with a video directed by Gustaf Holtenäs, who also directed the video for "Slow" from "Cavalcade". On 15 June, a new single titled "Eat Men Eat" was released and features a music video by Maxim Kelly, who also directed the music video for "Concorde" by Black Country, New Road. On 12 July, the third single, "Sugar/Tzu" was released with a video directed by Noel Paul. \n\nOn 14 July 2022, the band hosted a listening party on their YouTube channel, playing the entire album.\n\nSelected vinyl pre-orders of "Hellfire" came with flexi discs of several of the band's tracks throughout their career, all recorded live at Electrical Audio by Steve Albini in November 2021:\n\n- US independent retailers had a green flexi disc of "Sugar/Tzu" available.\n\n- UK independent retailers had a blue flexi disc of "Near DT, MI" available.\n\n- Japanese retailers had a black flexi disc of "27 Questions" available.\n\n- Rough Trade shops had a clear flexi disc of "953" available.\n\n- Worldwide retailers had a red flexi disc of "Eat Men Eat" available.\n\n- Rough Trade Records and the band's online store had an orange flexi disc of "Chondromalacia Patella" available.\n\n"Hellfire" received a score of 79 out of 100 based on fourteen critics' reviews at review aggregator Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim" reception. Steve Erickson of Slant Magazine described the album as a "concept album ripe for repeat listens" designed to be heard in its entirety, which "engages with rock’s history while simultaneously taking it in imaginative new directions". Writing for The Line of Best Fit, Kyle Kohner found "Hellfire" to be Black Midi at "their most devilish and maniacal", sounding "miraculously and hideously new, proving their aversion to any mindless repetition". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/black+midi/Hellfire">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On March 17, 2022, Cain released the single "Gibson Girl", subsequently announcing her debut album release.\n\nIn an interview with Alternative Press, Ethel said: “The story centers around three generations of women, and it starts with the youngest, the daughter. It’s pretty much just a classic American tale. A common theme that I like to write about is intergenerational trauma. Things that have been passed down through generations and how your parents’ or your grandparents’ actions can affect you. It’s very much about this lineage of women and how all their lives interconnect. Each album focuses on a different woman. I want to explore how your actions affect others and the relationship between a mother and her child and how things come full circle. Overall, it’s definitely a cautionary tale of what happens if you don’t break a cycle and you let it continue to almost a ruinous point. It’s what I see as a dark timeline of what would happen if everything hit its lowest point. So it’s very much bittersweet and like a melodrama. This first record is about this girl who is dealing with things from her past that her family has led her to being involved in and her trying to find a place in the world and break out of it. It’s going to be a big epic centered around her.“ <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Ethel+Cain/Preacher%27s+Daughter">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3831 `Vinyl Days is the seventh studio album by Maryland rapper Logic, and was released June 17, 2022 by Visionary Music Group and Def Jam Recordings. The album is Logic's final album with Def Jam Recordings. It contains 30 songs, making it the album with the most tracks in his discography, and features notable guest appearances from DJ Premier, RZA, Royce da 5'9, The Game, AZ, Russ, Action Bronson, Wiz Khalifa, and many others.\n\nThe project was first announced & teased on his social media on January 11, 2022. Since then, Logic had been previewing verses online.\n\nThe album would contain a lot of samples, hence Logic announcing that the project would be released once all the samples clear. In May 2022, Logic released a TikTok revealing the features that appeared on his album alongside a release date of June 17, 2022.\n\nThe project was first announced and teased on his social media on January 11, 2022. "Decades" and "Tetris" were released as the first two singles of the project on April 22. Logic spoke out on social media about mistreatment by his label, Def Jam, detailing that they had messed up his release plans for the singles and subsequent music video. He then announced the project would be slated for a June 2022 release. The album contains a lot of samples, hence Logic announcing that the project would be released once all the samples clear. On the Pep Talk Podcast prior to the album's release, Logic noted that Vinyl Days was created in a 12-day span and that the creative process was turned into a documentary to accompany the release. The album art can be characterized as a photo of Logic's son, Bobby, sitting on an office chair in the middle of a messy room riddled with various pop culture references. Some of the pop culture references on the album cover include a Back to the Future Part II hoverboard, the same type of drum machine that the revered J Dilla used (MPC 3000), a baby Groot from the film series Guardians of the Galaxy, a poster of Quentin Tarantino's ninth film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a teaser poster for Kill Bill: Volume 3, an MF DOOM poster, Eazy-E's 1988 Eazy-Duz-It album, electric guitars, recording equipment, dozens of vinyl records, and a green road sign which previews the title of his next album College Park, which he announced on numerous songs throughout the album such as "LaDonda", "Clouds", "Kickstyle", and "Sayonara".\n\nVinyl Days was released on June 17, 2022. Prior to the album's release, he released music videos for "Breath Control", "Clouds", and "Tetris" respectively. In an interview with NPR after the album's release, Logic said "I chose Vinyl Days because we actually recorded the entire album in about 12 days, for a wild reason that I'll explain another time".\n\nA verse in the song, "LaDonda", revolving around music critic Anthony Fantano, who had given Logic negative reviews in the past, generated controversy and discussion online due to a portion of the verse in which Logic recounts, “I used to fantasize about murdering you, choking you to death and watching from your point of view ’til we got friendly”. Fantano, not having been alerted of the contents of the verse ahead of time, heard the line for the first time during a livestream, causing him to go on a rant, stating that the line had made him feel “embarrassed”, further adding, “I feel overemphasized. There never should have been any reason Logic should hate me in the first place. Because I’m just reviewing albums. You’re just one of many guys whose albums I review negatively.” However, Fantano did ultimately give the album a positive review.\n\nThe album was released in the same week as projects by two high-profile hip-hop artists, Honestly, Nevermind by Drake and Khaza by Kevin Gates.\n\nOn July 4, over two weeks after the release of the album, Logic announced that he had signed to BMG. Speaking on signing with BMG, he stated “I’m just glad to move on to a place where I can be independent, and respected as an artist, and feel like I’m in control of my career.”\n\nOn July 16, Logic released a documentary that detailed the making and inspirations for the album.\n\nVinyl Days was expected to debut on the Billboard 200 with projected sales of 35,000 to 45,000 units. Vinyl Days debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 chart. This became Logic's eighth US top 20 debut. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Logic/Vinyl+Days">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3809 `"Palaces" is the third studio album by Australian electronic musician Flume, released on 20 May 2022 through Future Classic. It includes collaborations with Oklou, May-a, Quiet Bison, Kučka, Laurel, Virgen María, Emma Louise, Caroline Polachek and Damon Albarn. The album was announced alongside the release of lead single "Say Nothing", featuring MAY-A.\n\nAfter returning to Australia following the end of his world tour in support of "Skin" and "Hi This Is Flume", Flume moved to a coastal town in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, where he says he found "inspiration from the flora and fauna surrounding him". He also made field recordings of birds, which are used throughout the album. According to Flume, the album was also influenced by late Scottish producer Sophie. The artwork for the album represents the main narrative, where a bird in the jungle accidentally bites an Internet cable, causing it to observe the entirety of human knowledge. Seeing that mankind's history has been driven by commerce, the birds of the jungle create the Devalue Human Life Corporation (or DHLC), an organization dedicated to taking control of the planet away from humanity.\n\nFlume announced the album and its track listing on 2 February 2022, also releasing the song "Say Nothing" featuring May-a as the album's lead single and its music video the same day. The video contains similar visuals to those Flume uploaded on his NFT website throughout 2021. Flume said the track is about "feelings of post relationship clarity" and was written "midway through 2020 while the pandemic was still pretty new", although it was finished in early 2021. "Sirens" featuring American singer Caroline Polachek, was released as the second single on 1 April 2022. "ESCAPE" co-produced by QUIET BISON and featuring Australian singer Kučka, and "Palaces" featuring British singer Damon Albarn, were released as the third and fourth singles on 24 April 2022. "Hollow" featuring Australian singer Emma Louise, was released on 18 May 2022 as the fifth single. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flume/Palaces">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3808 `Harry's House is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter Harry Styles. It was released on May 20, 2022. Its hit lead single that went #1 on all platforms, "As It Was" was released on April 1, 2022. Harry's House debuted at #1  on the U.S. Apple Music album charts. It is also the first album in Spotify history to have all of its tracks surpass 5M streams on its first day.\n\nThe album is the product of a chain reaction. Had the pandemic not thrown his world into a tailspin in early 2020, he would’ve continued to tour behind Fine Line, his critically adored sophomore album, and played its songs hundreds of times for sold-out crowds around the world. A return to the studio was planned, of course, but when COVID-19 canceled those plans too, Styles faced an empty calendar for the first time in a decade. The singer opted to use this free time carefully, taking a solo road trip through Italy and visiting with family and friends for rare long, drawn-out stretches. It was an important moment of reevaluation. “You miss so many birthdays,” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And eventually it's just assumed you're unable to be at stuff. Finally I was like, ‘I want to balance my life out a bit. Working isn’t who I am, it's something I do. I want to be able to put that down.’”\n\nHis upbeat, lightly electronic third LP riffs on the concept of home, viewing it less as a geographical location and more as a state of mind—his mind. “Imagine it’s a day in my house, a day in my mind,” he said. “What do I go through? I’m playing fun music. I’m playing sad music. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff.” Because of the pandemic, Styles recorded the songs with a small handful of longtime friends and close collaborators who gathered in a single room to drink wine, write, and play. That intimacy is reflected in the songs, which are conversational and casually confessional, as if he’s thinking out loud. Blending vintage folk rock with flickers of disco and a generally more relaxed sensibility, they illustrate a turning point in Styles’ career as he transitions even further towards career singer-songwriter. “For a while it was, how do I play that game of remaining exciting?” he says. “But I finally had a moment where I felt like, ‘Okay, I’m not the young thing, so I would like to really think about who I want to be as a musician.’”\n\nHarry's House won the Grammy for Album of the Year in February of 2023. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/Harry%27s+House">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

During an interview with Apple Music on February 18, the same day “Nail Tech” was released, Jack provided more details about the creative process of CHTKMY: I think everybody will understand once I give them this new work. I feel like I haven’t had a chance to lay on the world just how passionate and how studious I am, and just how capable I am. And I think when I finish this album, it’ll be time for some of that. I think it’ll be refreshing for me to get into some of that. But right now, I’m in total work mode, man.

On March 31, Harlow played a short snippet of the album’s second single “First Class” in his IGTV, with the caption: Locked in the studio finishing up this album for you. How ‘bout this one next? The following day, Harlow went to Instagram and officially announced the release date of the song, which features a particular sample of Fergie’s January 2007 hit “Glamorous”. He revealed the album’s cover art on Twitter on April 6, 2022, and released “First Class” two days later.

3794 'MAHAL is the seventh studio album by American musician Toro y Moi, released on April 29, 2022, through Dead Oceans, as his first release under this label. The title is derived from the Tagalog word "mahal", which translates to "love" or "expensive" in English.\n\n"I feel like I’m bold here: I’m in a place where I’m confident in what I have to say and how I’m going to say it. there’s several audiences that I’m trying to cater to as I grow. It’s all about being intentional, things may take a little bit longer, sometimes even making the right lyrics or sounds. It has to feel right and be an example of progress. I want to give to all of these themes and more.\n\nMahal means either “expensive” or “love” in the Tagalog language, something I’ve inherited from my identity as an African-American of Filipino descent. Even naming a J Dilla-esque song after a Filipino word, I didn’t have the vision or didn’t know where it was going at the time, but taking time to build these worlds, feel out what I want to say. That allows me to explore who I am and put that on paper in a way that best represents my thoughts and feelings."\n\n– Toro y Moi, via Bandcamp Daily <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Toro+y+Moi/MAHAL">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3780 `Aethiopes is the tenth studio album by the prolific Brooklyn rapper billy woods. It sees him collaborating with producer Preservation, both of whom previously teamed up on woods' Terror Management and also on Preservation’s own Eastern Medicine, Western Illness. The album was released on April 8, 2022, through backwoodz studioz.\n\nIn an interview with FADER, billy stated that this is his largest and most broad album conceptually. This is reflected in the album’s title “aethiopes,” a word with an uncertain definition. Historically, the word referred to dark-skinned people living in certain areas (specifically the south of the Sahara but also within the upper Nile). However, modern usage typically alludes to the country of Ethiopia.\n\nWhen asked about the concept of the album during an interview with FADER, Woods said:\n\n"Conceptually, it was one of the  complex ideas I’ve ever tried to tackle on an album. It’s a lot of ideas, big and small, of a significant depth. I guess, to me, there’s a lot going on about Blackness as an idea, Africa as an idea, Africa as a reality. The diaspora, looking at the land and vice versa. And obviously, from the cover to the title itself, the idea of the other. Thinking about the real Ethiopia, which comes up more than once, both sonically and in words. Half of my family is Jamaican, and I have Rastas in my family who feel like Haile Selassie was God, the Messiah. And half of my family is from Africa, although nowhere near Ethiopia. But again, you’re talking about the other, and ideas of Blackness, which don’t necessarily have to line up with the reality of it. It’s an idea — like, Europeans decided what Blackness was."\n\n"Aethiopes" is billy woods’ first album since 2019’s double feature of Hiding Places and Terror Management. The project is fully produced by Preservation (Dr Yen Lo, Yasiin Bey), who delivered a suite of tracks on Terror Management, including the riveting single “Blood Thinner”. The two collaborated again on Preservation’s 2020 LP Eastern Medicine, Western Illness, which featured a memorable billy woods appearance on the song “Lemon Rinds”, as well as the B-side “Snow Globe”.\n\n- via Billy Woods' BandCamp <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Woods/Aethiopes">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3762 `"mainstream sellout" is the sixth studio album by American rock musician Machine Gun Kelly, released on March 25, 2022, via Bad Boy Records and Interscope Records. It is his second collaborative project with drummer and producer Travis Barker, following 2020's tickets to my downfall. In August 2021, the album was announced under its original title "Born with Horns", by which it was known until being renamed in January 2022.\n\nThe album was first announced on August 9, 2021, on Instagram, where Kelly and collaborator Travis Barker revealed matching tattoos of the phrase "born with horns", the album's previous title. Kelly announced that he and Barker were "back for round two", a reference to his fifth album Tickets to My Downfall, his first collaboration with Barker. Barker will return to produce "mainstream sellout".\n\nThe album's lead single "papercuts", was released on August 11, 2021. The accompanying music video was directed by Cole Bennett. A 20-second teaser of a song was teased on Instagram prior to the album announcement: the post was captioned "Signed a deal; I got papercuts", which matched the lyrics in the clip. Previews teased that he had shaved his head for the music video, though it was later revealed to be a bald cap. The song has led journalists to believe he was continuing in the pop punk direction of "Tickets to My Downfall". The song addresses Kelly's struggles with his own fame.\n\nIn October 2021, Kelly described the album as "darker" and more "guitar-heavy" than "Tickets to My Downfall". He also hinted at a New Year's Day release date. On January 31, 2022, Kelly announced that the album had been re-titled to "mainstream sellout". On February 4, 2022, Kelly announced the release date of the album and released the second single "emo girl" featuring Willow.

The album cover attracted comparisons to that of Japanese Breakfast's 2021 album "Jubilee", though Michelle Zauner denied the similarities, feeling the comparisons were manufactured to try to create controversy. On March 16, 2022, after having performed "maybe" during Emo Nite in Los Angeles, Kelly released the track as the fourth single of the album. The song features the lead vocalist, Oliver Sykes, of British rock band Bring Me the Horizon.

3751 `WHO CARES? is the fourth studio album by Rex Orange County, it was released on the 11th of March, 2022 by Sony Music Entertainment/RCA and is the follow-up from his first major-label studio album Pony.\n\nIt was supported by three singles prior to it's release: KEEP IT UP, AMAZING and  OPEN A WINDOW (feat. Tyler, The Creator). The album features a guest appearance from Tyler, The Creator.\n\nWhat Rex said when asked about WHO CARES?: I wanted to get out for a minute and my friend and I went to Amsterdam—a place I love very much. We went by car, so we didn’t touch anything anywhere, any person. Just like door to door, from London to Amsterdam. I have a good friend there called Benny Sings, who’s an artist—we made  “Loving Is Easy” together. So we went in with him for two days, and that’s where  “KEEP IT UP” came from. It’s probably very inspired by feeling like I didn’t want to keep it up and didn’t feel very good—so I wanted something motivational, some kind of an affirmation.\n\nThere’s the side that loves synths and electronic music and dance music, a song called “IF YOU WANT IT”. There’s a side to me that’s my favourite type of music in the world, which is just ¾ timing, or 6/8 timing, a song called “MAKING TIME”, and it’s saying the same lyric over and over again. There’s a song on there that sounds like it should have been a James Bond song. To me this feels like one side. This was made in 2020, and I’d want people to know there’s a whole other side that I’m working on that’s very, very exciting. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rex+Orange+County/WHO+CARES%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3721 `Ants From Up There is the second studio album by British rock band Black Country, New Road, released on 4 February 2022 on Ninja Tune. Recorded at Chale Abbey on the Isle of Wight, the album was produced by the band's live sound engineer Sergio Maschetzko, and is the final album to feature lead vocalist and guitarist Isaac Wood, who announced his departure from the band on 31 January 2022, four days prior to the album's release.\n\nWritten during COVID-19 lockdowns and road-tested during brief touring stints in support of their debut album "For the first time", the album was released almost exactly a year after their debut, and was preceded by four singles: "Chaos Space Marine", "Bread Song", "Concorde" and "Snow Globes". The album received unanimous critical acclaim upon its release. It became Black Country, New Road's highest-charting album, debuting at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n“We were really, really hyped making this record,” says Lewis Evans of Black Country, New Road. “We all love every single moment of this album.” \n\nMost bands, having been at the centre of a whirlwind of hype and critical acclaim, would be happy to stick to a winning formula for repeat success but creative stagnation is of zero interest to BC,NR who have swiftly returned with a follow album that takes yet another bold and innovative musical leap. \n\nTheir debut, For the first time, is a 2021 Album of the Year, receiving ecstatic reviews and picking up a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize, and the band have harnessed the momentum from that record and run full pelt into their second. On their debut album, the band (Evans, May Kershaw, Charlie Wayne, Luke Mark, Isaac Wood, Tyler Hyde and Georgia Ellery) melded klezmer, post-rock, indie and an often intense spoken word delivery. On Ants From Up There they have expanded on this unique concoction to create a singular sonic middle ground that traverses classical minimalism, indie-folk, pop, alt-rock and a distinct tone that is already unique to the band.\n\nGiven the incredible acclaim for the band’s debut, some second album jitters would be forgiven or perhaps expected, but that’s not the case here, such is the laser focus on forward momentum. “I understand how that may be for some bands,” says Evans. “You get all of this buzz around you and if you still haven't come up with your new sound, you can really start to pander to what you think people want and that’s not always good. I think if we did that people would want a record that sounded even more like Slint.” \n\nTracks such as “Chaos Space Marine” combine sprightly violin, rhythmic piano, and stabs of saxophone to create something infectiously fluid that bubbles to a rounding crescendo. It’s a track that Wood calls “the best song we’ve ever written.” It’s a chaotic yet coherent creation that ricochets around unpredictably but also seamlessly. “We threw in every idea anyone had with that song,” says Wood. “So the making of it was a really fast, whimsical and silly approach - like throwing all the shit at the wall and just letting everything stick.”\n\nThrowing every idea the band has into something is symbolic of an album bursting with ideas and zealous creativity. “Bread Song” might be rooted in something hugely relatable and every day - bread crumbs in bed - but the lyrics were tweaked and thought about in various stages over a four-year period. And musically - a song that is tender and stripped back but swells up in beautiful moments that engulf the listener like crashing waves - it contains equal depth. “We wanted to do the first chorus with no time signature,” says Wood. “I went to see Steve Reich do Music for 18 Musicians and there's a piece where a bar length is determined by the breadth of the clarinet player, they just play until they run out of breath. I wanted to try that with the whole band, where we don't look at each other, we don't make too many cues, we just try and play without time - but together.” \n\n“Haldern” is an attempt to record the spirit and intuition of spontaneous improvisation. It stems from a live stream performance at Haldern Pop Festival in Germany. “Every now and then in the middle of a gig, we'll do some improvisation because it can be really fun,” says Wood. “When we did it this time we basically wrote a whole song, which is the first time we've ever done that.” It’s another song from the album that aims to capture the magic of the moment, a one-off musical creation that can never be entirely replicated again. Whereas the gently stirring “The Place Where He Inserted the Blade” pays homage to late-period Bob Dylan. “I started writing this in response to, or heavily inspired by, “I've Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You”,” says Wood of the 2020 Dylan track. “The whole weird bluesy loungy thing where all the instruments blend into one another really appealed to me.”  \n\n“Concorde” swings from one of the most tender moments on the album-opening with tip-tap drums, twisting guitar lines

The album, which is primarily produced by the Weeknd, features additional contributions from Max Martin, Oscar Holter, Swedish House Mafia, Quincy Jones, and Oneohtrix Point Never, among others.\n\nThe Weeknd first teased the album in May 2021 during an interview with Variety, where he stated that "The Dawn is coming". On January 1, 2022, The Weeknd teased a possible surprise album release on Instagram, where he shared a screenshot of a text conversation contemplating releasing the album soon.

In terms of chart positions, it was the most successful Cocteau Twins album, reaching No. 7 in the UK.\n\nDespite 4AD president Ivo Watts-Russell proclaiming it one of the best-ever releases on his label, he released the group from their contract at the end of 1990 because his relationship with the band had soured.\n\nThe album is noteworthy for the musical evolution that the band displayed at the time. The lyrics of vocalist Elizabeth Fraser were more intelligible; many concerned her newborn daughter Lucy Belle. "Suddenly I had confidence which I'd never ever had in my life," Fraser said, "which I consequently lost after I had the baby, because it's such a frightening experience you lose it again and you have to start over again. But it does change you.".\n\nGuitarist Robin Guthrie was experiencing problems with drug addiction. As a result of his decreased time in the studio, bassist Simon Raymonde's playing was more in the forefront.\n\n"We've had it in the back of our mind that we wanted to play live again," said Guthrie at the time of the album's release, "so we thought we'd make some of the pieces more like songs we could actually play live… We like it better than all our last records. That's why we continue to make more – because if we made the perfect record we'd sit back and say, 'We can't do any better than that.' We think all our other ones are fucking crap. I'm slightly proud of a couple of tracks on a couple of them, but essentially I'm really embarrassed about what we've done in the past…".\n\nThe album has received positive critical acclaim. "Heaven or Las Vegas is their finest hour yet," enthused Martin Aston in Q. "Ten exquisite moments that make Kate Bush – their only possible comparison – sound as airborne as Motörhead." The album subsequently featured in the magazine's "best of the year" roundup: "The Cocteaus continue on their inimitable course, blissfully regardless of what's going on in the world outside their surreal reality."\n\n"You may be able to dig out some of the words," wrote Andrew Perry in Select, "you may even get to hear some of the songs live, but Heaven Or Las Vegas is Cocteau Twins in their usual, spectacular and enigmatic context." "In times when every other pop group is dragging on board whatever chemicals, '60s techniques and hypno-rhythms they can grab in order to achieve the desirable blissed-out condition," said Roger Morton in Vox, "it's a good joke that the Cocteaus can get there with such apparent effortlessness."'\n\nIt was listed as the 90th best album of the 1990s by Pitchfork Media, who complimented Fraser's more direct vocals and the album's complex songwriting. The album was also included in the 2008 edition of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and in The Guardian's online edition of a similar list. It was considered the band's strongest work since Treasure by AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett, who described it as "simply fantastic" and successful in creating "more accessibility".\n\n"Heaven or Las Vegas" was named by NME as the 28th best album of 1990. Retrospectively, The Observer listed the album as the 97th greatest British album ever made. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins/Heaven+or+Las+Vegas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The opening "Love's in Need of Love Today" and "Have a Talk with God" are curiously subdued, but Stevie soon kicks into gear with "Village Ghetto Land," a fierce exposé of ghetto neglect set to a satirical Baroque synthesizer. Hot on its heels comes the torrid fusion jam "Contusion," a big, brassy hit tribute to the recently departed Duke Ellington in "Sir Duke," and (another hit, this one a Grammy winner as well) the bumping poem to his childhood, "I Wish." Though they didn't necessarily appear in order, Songs in the Key of Life contains nearly a full album on love and relationships, along with another full album on issues social and spiritual. Fans of the love album Talking Book can marvel that he sets the bar even higher here, with brilliant material like the tenderly cathartic and gloriously redemptive "Joy Inside My Tears," the two-part, smooth-and-rough "Ordinary Pain," the bitterly ironic "All Day Sucker," or another classic heartbreaker, "Summer Soft." Those inclined toward Stevie Wonder the social-issues artist had quite a few songs to focus on as well: "Black Man" was a Bicentennial school lesson on remembering the vastly different people who helped build America; "Pastime Paradise" examined the plight of those who live in the past and have little hope for the future; "Village Ghetto Land" brought listeners to a nightmare of urban wasteland; and "Saturn" found Stevie questioning his kinship with the rest of humanity and amusingly imagining paradise as a residency on a distant planet. If all this sounds overwhelming, it is; Stevie Wonder had talent to spare during the mid-'70s, and instead of letting the reserve trickle out during the rest of the decade, he let it all go with one massive burst. (His only subsequent record of the '70s was the similarly gargantuan but largely instrumental soundtrack Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants.)\n\nSongs In The Key Of Life eventually went on to be certified diamond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/Songs+in+the+Key+of+Life">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released by Kill Rock Stars on 21 July 1995 in CD and vinyl LP. It was Smith's first full-length release on the label.\n\nThe album is mostly acoustic, in contrast to Smith's later works which were often more instrumentally layered. Thematically, Smith said that he "personally can't get more dark" than his self-titled album.\n\nMusical style\n\nThe album is of a similar musical style to Roman Candle and Either/Or in its minimalist, acoustic sound. Smith mostly appears alone on his acoustic guitar, although he is occasionally backed up by the odd musical instrument, such as a harmonica and drums. The lyrics are arguably Smith's darkest and most cutting, dealing with subjects like substance abuse (St. Ides Heaven, Needle in the Hay) and loss (Good to Go), although the album does also have a comforting, gentler sound.\n\nSmith's gentle fingerpicking on the album has been noted by many critics, and the album has been described as a fusion of "the Beatles' pop sense with Neil Young's sense of doom". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith/Elliott+Smith">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the only Hendrix studio album professionally produced under his supervision. It topped the Billboard 200 album chart for two weeks in November 1968. Released as a double album, Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic "Burning of the Midnight Lamp", previously a U.K. single in the summer of 1967; the extended blues jam "Voodoo Chile"; the New Orleans-style R&B; of Earl King's "Come On"; the epic studio production of "1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)"; the social commentary of "House Burning Down"; and the Sixties-era Britpop of Noel Redding's "Little Miss Strange". The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan classic "All Along the Watchtower", which has been well received by critics as well as by Dylan classic "All Along the Watchtower", which has been well received by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire.\n\nFollowing the first installment of recordings from Olympic Studios in London, including part of "All Along the Watchtower" and the aforementioned 1967 single, production moved during the spring of 1968 to the newly opened Record Plant Studios, situated close to Hendrix's favorite New York clubs. Recording there was by Jimi's favorite engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren. Despite a claim by Record Plant engineer Chris Stone that Kellgren engineered "90%" of Ladyland, the studio records show that most of the work was done by Kramer, only three tracks including the one by Redding having Kellgren as engineer.\n\nDuring the recording of the album, Hendrix fell out with producer Bryan "Chas" Chandler and Redding. Both of them grew tired with the undisciplined way Hendrix was working in the studio, because he was constantly inviting his friends and acquaintances in there. Chandler hated spending so much time in the studio and partly blamed it on these guests, but Jimi was determined to have his way. Chandler also complained that Hendrix's insistence on doing multiple takes of every song, combined with what he saw as Hendrix's drugged incoherence, led him to sell his share of the management company to his partner Michael Jeffery. Chandler quit in May 1968, leaving Hendrix sole producer on the project.\n\nHendrix' studio perfectionism was legendary – he and Mitch Mitchell recorded well over 50 takes of "Gypsy Eyes" over three sessions, Hendrix was generally insecure about his voice and often recorded his vocals hidden behind studio screens. Hendrix sang all the backing vocals himself on the title track and on "Long Hot Summer Night". He was said to be very happy with the vocal results on "Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)".\n\nMany of the album tracks show Hendrix's vision expanding far beyond the scope of the original trio and saw him collaborating with a range of outside musicians including Dave Mason, Chris Wood and Steve Winwood from Traffic; future Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles; Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady; former Dylan organist Al Kooper; and members of 'the Serfs': Mike Finnegan on organ, Freddie Smith on saxophone, and Larry Faucette on congas. Cooperation between Hendrix and Redding, who was of the same opinion about time spent in the studio as Chandler, was strained during production. Hendrix plays bass on many tracks, including the bass solo on "1983". At times Hendrix recorded bass tracks simply to make things proceed faster. Redding plays acoustic guitar and sings lead vocals with Mitchell on "Little Miss Strange". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience/Electric+Ladyland">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3677 `"Valentine" is the second studio album by Snail Mail. It was released on November 5, 2021 through Matador Records. Lindsey Jordan tried to begin writing material for her second album immediately after her debut "Lush". However, she struggled to write because she was on tour and lacked opportunities for solitude. During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan returned to her parents' home in Baltimore, where she began to start working seriously on "Valentine". In November 2020, Jordan spent 45 days in a rehab facility in Arizona, an experience she references directly in "Ben Franklin".\n\n"Valentine" received critical acclaim upon release, earning a Metacritic score of 88/100 and the 'Best New Music' certification by Pitchfork. Olivia Horn of Pitchfork wrote that Jordan "flirts with pop—sharpening her hooks, reaching for the synths and strings", in contrast to the "limited possibilities of a three-piece rock band" on her previous album "Lush". Horn rated the album 8.5/10, stating that Jordan's songwriting was "dazzlingly sharp and passionate". In a glowing review for NME, El Hunt wrote that "Jordan's songwriting is as astute as ever, and her exploration of love here is set to a rich palette of explorative strings and synths", rating the album 5 stars out of 5. Writing for AllMusic, Marcy Donelson gave the album 3.5 starts out of 5, arguing that while Valentine represents a "bold musical step" for Jordan, it nevertheless "leaves some of her distinctiveness behind." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Snail+Mail/Valentine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3665 `Voyage is the ninth and final studio album by Swedish group ABBA, released on 5 November 2021. It is the group's first album of new material in 40 years.\n\n“I don’t know of anybody who’s done it,”ABBA’s Björn Ulvaeus tells Apple Music. “Is there anybody?” He could be talking about the improbability of a Swedish pop group comprising two formerly married couples selling nearly 400 million albums worldwide and counting. He could also mean their impending residency at a purpose-built arena in London in which all four members will perform as ABBAtars—painstakingly motion-captured renderings of their circa-1978 selves—with a live band, potentially until, or beyond, the collapse of civilisation. But he’s actually referring to the fact that ABBA is releasing their first album of new music in 40 years, an event that bears little historical precedent. “I constantly have those moments when I think, ‘How the hell did this all happen? Why is it that suddenly on TikTok two million people are following what we are doing?’ It's weird. It's all weird.”\n\nThis unlikely occurrence started becoming more likely around 2018 when Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson wrote two songs, the cheekily self-referential “I Still Have Faith in You” and “Don’t Shut Me Down”, for possible inclusion in the show, and approached their former partners, singers Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. “We asked the ladies and they were absolutely enthusiastic about going into the studio and trying their voices again,” Ulvaeus says. “And then after a while we thought, why not record a couple more? And there was absolutely nobody breathing down our necks.” The result is Voyage—nine new songs and one resurrected from their original incarnation, fitting for a project that renders the very notion of the passage of time meaningless. While ABBA's legacy is long since assured, their ABBAtars could revolutionise the prospects for artists looking to secure career options beyond this mortal coil. “The reason why it works is that we are still alive,” Ulvaeus says. “The cranium does not change over time. The rest of your body falls apart, but the cranium, they could take exact measurements, which they cannot with a video of Elvis. I bet you there are a lot of singers who will have these in a couple years. Everyone should have an ABBAtar.” Take a chance on these stories behind the songs on Voyage from Ulvaeus himself.\n\n"I Still Have Faith in You"\n“When Benny played it to me, I thought, ‘This is really epic.’ It's about us and the bonds we have, about the loyalty we have to each other, and celebrating the fantastic career that we've gone through. Or haven't gone through—there's a lot left of it, as it seems—but there are more layers than that today in that lyric, but that I want the listener to find out by himself.”\n\n"When You Danced With Me"\n“It's a bit Nordic, but maybe more Scottish and Irish. I lived in England for six years, between '84 and ’90, and I used to see these fairs that they had in the villages for the children. And that's what I saw before me when I heard the melody: a village fair, but somewhere in Ireland. It's about leavers and remainers. I grew up in a small town and I left it when I was 20. But somehow I'd come back to that little town and feel I have roots there.”\n\n"Little Things"\n“Benny tells me he didn't think of it as a Christmas song, but I, the minute I heard it, I said it cannot be anything else. It is early, early Christmas morning. The stockings are hanging right there and then this couple wakes up. This could be played for Christmases to come. And that would be great, because we want to own Christmas and New Year's Eve, like with  'Happy New Year'.”\n\n"Don't Shut Me Down"\n“At that time we were kind of getting the hang of what the ABBAtars would be. This is about a woman who has broken up and regrets breaking up. And she is going to come back and see if the guy will take her back. So she sits on a bench in a park and it gets dark. And finally she gets the courage up to go and knock on the door. That's it at face value, but I see it as us, as ABBAtars, knocking on the doors of the fans: Please take us as we are now and don't shut us down. It's a little flirt with the disco of the '70s, but other than that, I don't think that any of the old songs have had any impact on the new songs.”\n\n"Just a Notion"\n“It's from '78 and it's never been released in its entirety before. There's been snippets on YouTube, but we thought it's a great song and it has very good vocals on it. Benny did a new backing track, so the band is new but the voices are old. And it illustrates in a way what we are doing in the ABBAtar concert in London, because we will have a live band but the original vocals.”\n\n"I Can Be That Woman"\n“It's a country song, in essence. And a little gesture to the queen of country, as far as I'm concerned: Tammy Wynette. The good dog is called Tammy. There's a lot of stuff going into that song, but it's basically about someone who has come down from an addiction and finally come down into real life and is sorry about all the wasted years. But there's hope at the end of the tunnel: I can be that woman now. Only we know what is fact and what is fiction about our life experiences together. It's a kind of freedom that you get. With 70, you get that freedom.”\n\n"Keep an Eye on Dan"\n“Dan is the little child; his two parents are divorced and he is being left with one parent. All of us who have been divorced know what it's like to leave that little kid and seeing how absorbed that little kid is with the other parent. And he waves, or she, and you stand there and you feel, 'Argh.' I find it interesting to explore things that happen in relationships that haven't been explored before. I don't think that this has.”\n\n"Bumblebee"\n“I've always found bumblebees or squids as powerful symbols for what we might lose with climate change. It's a symbol of the loneliness we will feel when these creatures perhaps vanish because they cannot adapt.”\n\n"No Doubt About It"\n“I've known a few people who kind of flare up and can't help it, but then very quickly sort of get calm again and say, 'Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have said that.' So it is this woman, in that situation she is incensed with her husband, who is very calm. He knows, he just waits for it. And in the end it comes.”\n\n"Ode to Freedom"\n“The concept of freedom is so intriguing and it's so different for different kinds of people. This song is so majestic. I could never say what my freedom is, because that would be received as, 'Oh, you can say that you are rich, you're famous. Da, da.' This is not my ode to freedom; it's about how if I ever wrote one, it would be simple. I don't know what it would be about, but I wish someone would write one.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ABBA/Voyage">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3662 `Red (Taylor's Version) is the second re-recorded album by Taylor Swift. It was released on November 12, 2021, through Republic Records. It is a re-recording of Swift's fourth studio album, Red (2012), and follows her first re-recorded album, Fearless (Taylor's Version), which was released in April 2021. The re-recording is Swift's counter measure against the changed ownership of the masters to her first six studio albums. It features a set of unreleased tracks from the Red era billed as "From the Vault".\n\nRed (Taylor's Version) was met with widespread acclaim from music critics who admired Swift's vocal performances, the production quality, and the new tracks. Reviews described it as a classic pop record expanding from Swift's country roots into electronic, synth-pop and rock flairs, whilst chronicling various dynamics of love, life, loss and heartache. The album broke a string of commercial records, such as the Spotify feat for the largest single-day streams for an album by a female artist and the biggest vinyl sales week in MRC Data history. It topped the charts in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom, as well as the United States where Swift surpassed Elton John's 46-year-old record to become the fastest soloist in Billboard 200 history to collect four number-one albums, doing so in under 16 months. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/Red+(Taylor%27s+Version)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3659 'Still Over It is the second studio album by American singer Summer Walker, released on November 5, 2021, by LVRN and Interscope. On the two-year anniversary of her debut album, Walker announced the release of Still Over It through a video teaser. \nStill Over It charts a journey through a messy and complicated breakup. Walker wants you to know she’s singing about her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child, noted Atlanta producer London on da Track. London not only contributes production to half of the album; he’s also the subject of Walker’s lyrical anguish. Her sadness and insecurities aren’t theoretical, and her songwriting is most powerful when she’s descriptive about the depths of that agony: “How could you make me spend my whole fucking pregnancy alone?”\n\nWalker and London aren’t the album’s only contributors, nor the only characters in its story. Opening track “Bitter” is a hazy stream of consciousness where Walker presumably addresses her social-media spats with the mothers of London’s other children (“So why you puttin’ on for The Shade Room and Insta?” she questions). The track ends with a voicemail from Cardi B, who advises Walker to “put that drama in your music.” Lead single “Ex for a Reason”—featuring City Girls’ JT and co-produced by Sean Garrett—shines with a sleek hook and bubbly production reminiscent of Garrett’s early-2000s hits. On the pop-infused “No Love,” Walker and SZA regret defending a man who isn’t worth it: “Tried to act like I wasn’t good enough in your eyes/Funny now that you callin’, that you ringin’ my line,” Walker sings. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Summer+Walker/Still+Over+It">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3654 `Still Sucks is the sixth studio album by American nu metal band Limp Bizkit, released on October 31, 2021, through Suretone Records.\n\nAfter the original lineup reunited in 2009, the band’s fifth album Gold Cobra was released in 2011. They left Interscope and signed up with Cash Money Records in February 2012, with attempts to release a new album under the name Stampede of the Disco Elephants. The first intended single "Lightz (City of Angels)" was released on October 26, 2012. After many delays, the second single for the album, "Ready to Go", featuring labelmate Lil Wayne, was released on April 16, 2013.\n\nOn November 1, 2013, the band released a new single "Thieves", a cover of the song by the industrial metal band Ministry. Another single, "Endless Slaughter" was released on August 1, 2014, through their website for free download. After numerous delays, the album was expected in early 2014. The band officially left Cash Money Records on October 26, 2014, stating that; "While we had a lot of fun making 'Ready to Go' with Lil Wayne, which turned out into a great song, we decided that they wanted to go a different route creatively, but we still have respect for everyone at Cash Money and look forward to the future and the release of Stampede of the Disco Elephants.”\n\nThe album remained in development hell for years with no release date set. Guitarist Wes Borland had already completed writing and performing guitars for the record, but stated in late 2017 that frontman Fred Durst was still working on his parts. Borland again reiterated the band's progress in November 2018. In July 2017, Durst claimed on Instagram that the album had already been available online for a year and a half on Soulseek, but Borland refuted this saying he “doesn’t know what  is talking about.” All four songs that had been published publicly between 2012 and 2014 were since removed from the album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit/Still+Sucks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3636 `"Punk" (Stylized as PUNK) is American rapper Young Thug second studio album. It was released on 15 October 2021 through YSL Records and is distributed by Atlantic Records and 300 Entertainment. The album features packed guest appearances from Strick, J. Cole, T-Shyne, Gunna, Future, BSlime, the late Juice Wrld, Post Malone, ASAP Rocky, Lil Double 0, Drake, Travis Scott, Doja Cat, Nate Ruess, Jeff Bhasker, and the late Mac Miller. Production is handled by a variety of record producers, including T-Minus, Metro Boomin, Kanye West, Pi'erre Bourne, Wheezy, Oz, Louis Bell, and Watt, among others. In an interview about recording his debut studio album, So Much Fun (2019), Young Thug told The Fader that he wanted to release a follow-up album in the "upcoming weeks". In contrast to his debut, which he described as a "lighthearted work", Punk would be more personal and introspective. He implied that the new album was "touching" and interpreted the meaning of Punk as "brave, not self centered, conscious, very, very neglected, very misunderstood, very patient, very authentic". He said the album would reflect "real rap". On July 27, 2021, Thug featured on an NPR Tiny Desk home concert, where he performed four new songs and teased an October 15 release date for the album, as seen on the back of his t-shirt. More promotion for Punk is a video published on October 13, 2021, of Thug smashing a $320,000 Rolls-Royce with the word "punk" painted on it in pink. Following Punk’s release, Thug stated during his appearance on The Breakfast Club that his track "Day Before" with Mac Miller was recorded on the day before Miller's death on September 7, 2018. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug/PUNK">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3638 `"Juno" is Remi Wolf's debut studio album released on October 15th, 2021, under Island Records. The album showcases a mix of funk, pop and R&B influences, resulting in more experimental sounds and more chaotic energy in comparison to the artist's previous works.\n\nSince appearing on American Idol in 2014 and realising a life of conventionality was not for her, LA pop singer-songwriter Remi Wolf has graduated from USC Thornton School of Music, released a series of EPs (2019’s You’re a Dog!, 2020’s I’m Allergic to Dogs! and 2021’s We Love Dogs!), scored a viral hit on TikTok (“Photo ID”) and signed a deal with Island Records. Juno—which, not surprisingly, is named after her dog—is her first full-length. “I raised him during the pandemic,” Wolf tells Apple Music of the album’s namesake. “He was with me for the writing of every song. He was my partner.” Juno mixes chaotic funk, maximalist melodies, psychedelic synths and absurdist lyrics for an album that’s as ebullient as that new pup. But making it was a different story. “There was this week where I wrote ‘Liquor Store’, ‘Anthony Kiedis’, ‘wyd’ and ‘Grumpy Old Man’,” she says. “I wrote all of those in three days. I was bursting at the seams. Mental-health-wise, it was one of the worst  I'd ever been . I was so completely and utterly miserable, and then we made some of my favourite songs on the album,” she says of her work with co-producer Jared Solomon. Here she goes deeper into how they all came together.\n\n“Liquor Store”\n“I wrote this song about having gotten recently sober, this big fear of abandonment that I have and this co-dependency issue that I've been dealing with for a long time. It’s one of my most vulnerable songs on the record. It was very cleansing for me. I said exactly what I was feeling. In my writing, I tend to do a lot of abstraction and surrealist imagery, just a lot of crazy shit. But that song is 'This is how it feels to be in my head right now.' I also wrote that song really, really fast. We probably finished it in four hours. I was crying. I was in and out of absolute breakdown, sobbing tears the entire time we were writing that song. The sacrifices we make out here.”\n\n“Anthony Kiedis”\n“I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis doesn't have that much to do with the song other than I was reading his memoir at the time, and he talked a lot about his relationship with his dad. I was inspired by that. The song is really about everything that I was going through in COVID and the way I was viewing myself at the time.”\n\n“wyd”\n“This is my funk song. This is like if Carlos Santana liked playing funk. But this song was also written in that big week of depression. I love my team, but at the time I was in such a tough spot and people were constantly wanting me to work. I was like, 'Hey, can you leave me alone?' So the line 'Little bitches telling me what to do' were my team, but that was just a moment in time. I was angry. Nobody tells me really what to do creatively, thank god. I have a lot of independence on that level.”\n\n“Guerrilla”\n“It is such an anxious-horny anthem. I started writing that in the beginning of the pandemic. We didn't really know what COVID was, so I was still going to hang out with some people, but it was a very anxious time in my life. But I was still horny. I named it 'Guerrilla' because when I would go to a party, it felt like guerrilla warfare. My own brain was attacking itself. I can be way too perceptive and care about other people's energy and let that affect me, and that just causes this crazy anxiety.”\n\n“Quiet on Set”\n“I made that song with my friend Jared  and my friend Elie . It was the first session that we had together with Elie. It was one of my most fun times I've ever had making music. The Chuck E. Cheese line came out of Elie being like, 'Guys, let's get some lunch.' He was like, 'Oh my god, should we Postmates Chuck E. Cheese?' I was like, 'Okay, that's going in the song right now.'”\n\n“Volkiano”\n“Jared had a session with this producer, Y2K . He was like, 'Remi, we don't have anybody to write a song for right now. Would you want to come through?' They had these chords down, and as soon as I heard the chords, I was like, 'I can write something to this.' We decided to keep the verses way more stripped down because I am speaking so fast and I want you to hear those words. It's definitely more of a dark pop sound. I'm super down for the variance. I want every song to be its own statement.”\n\n“Front Tooth”\n“I wrote this song with Jared and Kenny Beats at his studio in the Valley. Kenny played all the drums on the songs, and he put them through this crazy analogue gear to make them sound so huge. I wrote this song about how my career was going super well, the momentum was moving, but I felt like shit. It didn't feel how I wanted it to feel, and it didn't feel how everybody was telling me it should feel.”\n\n“Grumpy Old Man”\n“I feel like an old man, old woman, really weird person a lot of the time. I wrote this song about feeling like I was so unpleasant to be around. I was going through such a hard time, and that's such a thing that people with anxiety and depression often feel. They just want to isolate and not be around people because they feel like they're not very fun. I was in that state: 'Oh, I fucking suck.' It's pretty much a song about me hating myself, but we put it in this beautiful little danceable package.”\n\n“Buttermilk”\n“I wrote the song about a tumultuous relationship. Buttermilk is when you whip up cream, and you whip it to the point where it's butter, and the fat separates from the liquid. It happens very quickly. You'll have a big lump of butter in the bowl, but then you'll have all this buttermilk around it. I'm referring to my relationship, where one minute we're okay, but then the next minute we're fighting so much, like the process of making butter. It's about this relationship that is sometimes absolutely amusing and then sometimes it's just toxic and sour.”\n\n“Sally”\n“I actually wrote ‘Sally’ before any song on my second EP. I initially wrote it on acoustic guitar with my friend Julian McClanahan, who I went to college with. He is a great songwriter. We went to San Diego on this party/writing trip and did it there. Jared sometimes likes to name our project files weird things. So for a long time, it was just 'Sally Four'. Once it came down to like putting it on the album, everybody was like, 'Okay, do you want to just call this “Sally”?'”\n\n“Sexy Villain”\n“‘Sexy Villain’ I wrote with my power trio of my girly songwriters—Mary Weitz and Olivia Waithe. I wrote  ‘Disco Man’ with them, and ‘Buzz Me In’. I trust them a lot; they understand me, and they understand where I like going lyrically. At the time, I was watching and listening to a lot of true crime. I was in a relationship, and I was constantly feeling like the bad guy—even though I wasn't, but that's where my anxiety takes me a lot of the time. The sexy villain is my alter ego, in a sense—or it was that day.”\n\n“Buzz Me In”\n“We had so much champagne during that session. I remember I played guitar and came up with those chords, but I honestly can't really tell you anything about that song. It’s the classic booty call: 'Let me in, like, will you make me cum?' But the mental state I was in when I was writing that song was just absolutely drunk.”\n\n“Street You Live On”\n“I love this song. I made it with my friend Ethan Gruska, who I had just met for the first time the day that we started writing this. I had been a fan of him for six years. I think he's a genius. This is the closest I've gotten to a ballad thus far in my career, which is cool because I think that I need that. I believe it's one of my most well-written songs on the record. We kept joking that it sounds like the Bee Gees meets like Alex G. When you listen to this song, you feel really sad, but you also feel happy. There's like this undeniable nostalgia to it.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Remi+Wolf/Juno">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Speaking on the album title to The Guardian, Little Simz commented: "I'm just very to myself and I didn't know how to really navigate that, especially coming in this industry where you're expected to have this extroverted persona all the time. I wanted to just let people know like, yo, I'm actually this way inclined  When it comes to business and my work, I'm not shy at all, I don't hold back with that. I'm very serious and direct, but other stuff sometimes."

3589 `Solar Power is the third studio album by New Zealand singer and songwriter Lorde, released on 20 August, 2021 by Universal Music. Lorde wrote and produced the album with American musician Jack Antonoff, whom she worked with on her second studio album, Melodrama (2017), as well. She opted against CDs for environmental reasons, releasing Solar Power to digital music platforms, streaming services, and as vinyl LPs only.\n\nThe album was preceded by Going South, a June 2021 memoir documenting Lorde's 2019 visit to Antarctica, which she dubbed as the precursor to the album. She stated the title Solar Power was inspired by the trip, and that she "felt like  could just chill out and flex a little bit" while creating the record.\n\nClassified by Lorde as her "weed album", Solar Power is a psychedelic pop and indie folk effort driven by acoustic guitar arrangements, marking a departure from the synth-heavy, dance-oriented music of her previous works. The album's lyrics revolve around solipsism and summer escapism, mainly focusing on Lorde's leisure time in her homeland New Zealand, simultaneously expressing her disdain for fame and celebrity culture.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the year’s only solar eclipse, Lorde released the album’s lead single Solar Power and sent an email to fans, revealing it is also the album’s title. The song was also accompanied by a music video.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, the summer solstice, the album became available to pre-order on Lorde’s website, revealing the tracklist and final release date. She also sent another email to fans writing: \n"Greetings my babies, and happy solstice.\nFor those who don’t know, the summer solstice is the day when the Sun charts her longest course through the sky. It’s the longest and most light day of the year. Cultures have celebrated the solstice for thousands of years— with singing, dancing, ceremonies, fires, and feasts. It’s a day to toast fertility and hope for plentiful harvests. It’s one worth celebrating. And what better way to celebrate than with an EXTENSIVE DETAILS BULLETIN? (I’m joking, please go outside after reading this). I have so much to tell you. This is the first official bulletin from the Solar Institute, by the way. These may come every week or two weeks, depending on how I feel… Anyway. I have some major shit to announce so I gotta keep this moving. The album comes out August 20. It contains 12 songs and 2 bonus tracks."\n\nOn July 19, 2021, Lorde’s website updated once again and revealed that the second single, Stoned at the Nail Salon, would release two days later, on July 21, 2021.\n\nThe third single, Mood Ring, was released three days before the album’s release, on August 17, 2021.\n\nOn September 9, 2021, Lorde released Te Ao Mārama, an EP that acts as a companion piece to Solar Power, where she sings 5 of the songs in te reo Māori, an indigenous language of New Zealand.\n\nIts deluxe version was released digitally on November 5, 2021, containing two new tracks that had already been included in the music box: Helen of Troy and Hold No Grudge.\n\nThe album performed middling compared to her previous albums. It debuted at #1 in her native New Zealand, #2 in the UK and #3 in the US, with 75,000 copies in its first week. The album also debuted on the charts in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and other countries. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/Solar+Power">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3580 'SINNER GET READY is Lingua Ignota’s fourth studio album, released on August 6, 2021.\n\nLingua Ignota first mentioned a new album in an Instagram post on January 30, 2021, stating that it would be “coming later this year.” Exactly two month later, on March 30, 2021, she tweeted: SINNER GET READY is the title of the new record.\n\nOn June 17, 2021, the lead single “Pennsylvania Furnace” was released and the album appeared as a pre-release on Apple Music, revealing the artwork and final track list. The following day she officially revealed it with the caption:\n\nSINNER GET READY, in which I seek but fail to find God in God’s Own Country, in which I find betrayal and abandonment, fear and loneliness, judgment. I gave my pain a place, and the place is named Pennsylvania, and the record unfolded in tandem with the pain, and the landscape entangled me further. It was obsessive and heartbreaking to make. I agonized over how to give my pain to the music, that the music might take it, and the result is something that doesn’t sound like anything, including what I have sounded like before. I gave myself over to the atonal conviction of the evangelical chorus, the sharp wound of the bowed banjo and the psaltery and the dulcimer and the frantically ringing bell, and the desperate repetition of ecstatic language, language. All for god, all for nothing.\n\nThe palette was honed to create dissonance and darkness using traditional instruments often extended or prepared with very little electronic intervention with producer partner magician @seffffffy who always compels me to stay True. We nod to American Primitivism and the American avant-garde but subvert and explode those forms as well. Seth brought aboard our secret weapon @riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine (he of the Ozarks) and his incredible arrangements, which expanded the songs in wild beauty. We gave everything to each song, and each song is unhinged in its own way. Confrontationally mastered by @chrisgehringer at Sterling Mastering. Mask on cover by the amazing @ashleyrosecouture . Layout by @chimerenoire . Artwork by me.\n\nOn July 15, 2021, the second single “Perpetual Flame of Centralia” was released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lingua+Ignota/SINNER+GET+READY">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3575 `Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer Billie Eilish. It was released on July 30, 2021, by Darkroom and Interscope. Eilish wrote the album with her frequent collaborator, her brother FINNEAS, who produced the album himself. Eilish cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the album.\n\nPrimarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (2019). Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it. Upon release, the album received acclaim from music critics, who praised its stylistic, restrained production, and insightful lyrics. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and its title track received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nSeven singles were released in promotion of the album: "My Future", "Therefore I Am", "Your Power", "Lost Cause", "NDA", the title track, and "Male Fantasy"; the first three peaked within the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100. "Therefore I Am" was the highest-charting song from the album, peaking at number two, followed by "My Future" at number six, and "Your Power" at number 10. Happier Than Ever debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Eilish's second number-one album in the United States, and topping the album charts in 27 other countries. A Disney+ documentary concert film, Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, was released on September 3, 2021 and received a nomination for Best Music Film at the 2022 Grammys. To promote the album further, Eilish embarked on her fifth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, set to cover Europe, Oceania and North America in 2022.\n\nUpon release, Happier Than Ever received acclaim from music critics, who admired its resolute portrayal of teenage stardom contrasting its muted sound. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the album has a weighted mean score of 86 based on 27 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/Happier+Than+Ever">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3553 'Melbourne-based, worldwide-beloved, genre-fluid Hiatus Kaiyote returns in 2021 with their new album Mood Valiant. Nai Palm (guitar, vox), Paul Bender (bass), Simon Mavin (keys), and Perrin Moss (drums) debuted in 2012 with LP Tawk Tomahawk, making fans of Erykah Badu, Questlove, and Prince, and embraced by tastemakers like Gilles Peterson and DJ Jazzy Jeff. Their first R&B Grammy nomination, for “Nakamarra,” was followed by another for “Breathing Underwater,” from their second LP, 2015’s Choose Your Weapon. They’ve been sampled on songs by The Carters (Beyonce + Jay-Z), Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak, Chance The Rapper, and Drake, with whom Nai Palm collaborated on his Scorpion album. \n\nMood Valiant is the product of four years of writing, recording and touring, interrupted by a significant event: Nai Palm’s diagnosis with breast cancer. Her recovery and the band’s subsequent trip to Brazil to work with arranger Arthur Verocai led to “Get Sun”, which soars with Verocai’s orchestrations and rides the knotty grooves that Hiatus fans have come to expect. Through it all rings Nai’s singular verse and voice. “When you think your life is going to be taken away from you, it makes you think about who you are,” Nai says. “My only wish is to live and offer my experience of time and beauty.” Mood Valiant is out now via Brainfeeder Records / Ninja Tune. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hiatus+Kaiyote/Mood+Valiant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3537 `Hall of Fame is Chicago rapper Polo G’s third studio album, released June 11th 2021. The album’s title was first teased in a lyric from Polo’s unreleased collaboration with Scorey, “Pillow Talk,” where he references his two preceding studio albums, June 2019’s Die a Legend and May 2020’s THE GOAT:\n\n"Future Hall of Fame, then he the GOAT, yeah, he gon' die a legend"\n\nJust over month after announcing the album via Instagram live, Polo released what is assumed to be the project’s lead single, “Epidemic,” in September 2020. The track was followed months later by “GNF (OKOKOK)” in February 2021 and the long-awaited “RAPSTAR” in April.\n\nIn early March 2021, Polo reposted an Instagram story speculating the album’s impending release after adding the initials “HOF” to his bio, seemingly accrediting the speculation.

However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, the album’s rollout was indefinitely postponed.

3531 'A Tiny House, In Secret Speeches, Polar Equals marks the return of Sweet Trip, 12 years after the release of their third album, You Will Never Know Why. In usual Sweet Trip fashion, "Secret Speeches" was created out of the blue; nothing planned, not even a sense of direction. Instead, songs poured out with strong emotions and pure love, which dictated every note, every beat, every wash of sounds that adorns this new work.\n\nIn A Tiny House, In Secret Speeches, Polar Equals, Valerie and Roby have taken lessons learned from previous works: lush soundscapes reminiscent of Halica, strange digital manipulation and sound overload of velocity:design:comfort, the pop sensibility of You Will Never Know Why and have created something that stands on its own - a collection of love songs, ethereal slow jams, blissed out sexy grooves, a love letter in music and sound. "Secret Speeches" gives you a Sweet Trip that embraces their maturity, and still keeps things intriguing and unexpected. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sweet+Trip/A+Tiny+House,+in+Secret+Speeches,+Polar+Equals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3520 '"Cavalcade" is the sophomore studio album from the British rock band black midi, released on May 26th through Rough Trade records. It was released early to a live audience with the video “black midi – Cavalcade Listening Party Extravaganza”.\n\nThe album features an eclectic array of sounds and experimentation beginning with the explosive Avant-Garde Jazz track “John L” to the more cathartic and somber ballad “Marlene Dietrich.”\n\n“Their claim in a past interview that their music would soon be “unrecognisable” from their initial form suddenly doesn’t seem so ridiculous.

3513 `Scaled and Icy is the sixth studio album by American musical duo twenty one pilots, it was released May 21, 2021 by Fueled by Ramen and Elektra. Critics noted its return to the "playful alt-pop sound" of Vessel (2013), and a departure from the darker approach of its predecessors Blurryface (2015) and Trench (2018). The album has also been described as alternative rock, pop, rock, rap and synthpop, with elements of electro.\n\nThe album's title is a play on "scaled back and isolated", a phrase frontman Tyler Joseph associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the music produced at the time. On an interview with Sirius XM, he stated that he wanted to "lean into being aware that things are scaled back and that we're isolated". Despite that, Joseph's goal was to create an album that contrasts this very idea and that conveys the opposite of it. The album title is also an anagram of "Clancy is dead", a reference to the protagonist of Trench, the band has however neither described this as coincidental nor declined to comment on this subject. The title's initials appear on the cover art for their 2020 single "Christmas Saves the Year", on which the sentence "SAI is propaganda" is written in purple on one of the wrapped gifts.\n\nThe cover artwork for Scaled and Icy was designed by Brandon Rike, who also designed the cover art for Trench and Blurryface. It features a scaled, teal dragon breathing yellow fire over a pink background, as well as a psi symbol in the top right corner. The dragon is named Trash, and represents "inspiration, fear, and magic"; Joseph explained that he wanted to "tie the songs to something as powerful as that". The creature was originally drawn by British illustrator Walter Crane in a children's book from the 1860s (the artwork is in the public domain, allowing the band to use it in the album cover). Its usage was also inspired by a small dragon figurine Joseph keeps in his home studio, with Joseph revealing to BBC Radio 1 that it represented an idea that if he were to focus on a single detail of a small room, "then that detail can then come to life".\n\nAlthough a departure from the conceptual narrative found on Trench, the band largely continues to examine serious themes on Scaled and Icy despite its upbeat sound. Joseph explained that the contrast was deliberate, stating that "as you dive into lyrics, a lot of times it's asking some pretty heavy questions and addressing some pretty heavy things". Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic described the album as "a snapshot of the emotional highs and lows of quarantine life", while Augusta Battoclette of Alternative Press noted the themes of "anxiety, doubt and the need to keep your loved ones close".\n\nThe album was preceded by the singles "Shy Away", and "Choker", and "Saturday", "The Outside" was chosen as the fourth single later on.\n\nScaled and Icy received generally positive reviews from music critics overall. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 70, based on 9 critical reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". The album peaked at no. 03 in both the US and the UK. At the 2022 Billboard Music Awards, it won the Top Rock Album category. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/twenty+one+pilots/Scaled+and+Icy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3507 `The Off-Season is J. Cole’s sixth studio album and his first release of 2021.\n\nOn August 7, 2018, Cole released a freestyle titled “Album of the Year,” as a promotional single for the album. Its release doubled as the announcement of the LP. In both the SoundCloud and music video description, Cole writes:\n\n"The Off Season coming soon… All roads lead to The Fall Off"\n\nThe beginning of the “Album of the Year” music video references The Off-Season:\n\nThe artwork for “Album of the Year” also contained references to The Off-Season.\n\nCole continued to tease the album on November 9, 2018, when he created a Spotify playlist called “Where the fuck is The Off Season,” which, at the time, included many of his 2018 features and a few solo songs (it has been constantly updated).\n\nOn July 22, 2020, J. Cole released Lewis Street, a two-track release that included “Lion King on Ice” and “t h e . c l i m b . b a c k.” While they both were intended to be the lead singles to The Fall Off, it was revealed days before The Off-Season’s release that the latter would appear on the LP, therefore making “t h e . c l i m b . b a c k” the lead single to the album.\n\nOn December 29, 2020, Cole reignited the desire for The Off-Season when he posted a schedule of what he deemed “The Fall Off Era.” The calendar begins with two completed events, Cole’s famous feature run and Revenge of the Dreamers III, and they are followed by The Off-Season.\n\nAfter the album’s imminent release, the calendar lists (seemingly) the birth of Cole’s third son and the release of The Fall Off.\n\nOn April 28, Bas made an Instagram post alleging that Cole had completed The Off-Season and that it would be released in “two weeks” (he later deleted the post). Two days later, Cole posted on his Instagram story that he had “just rode through the city to The Off-Season,” both proclaiming his excitement for its release and confirming the legitimacy of Bas’ post.\n\nOn May 4, 2021, Cole revealed the release date and artwork for The Off-Season.\n\nOn May 7, Cole released the album’s second single, “​i n t e r l u d e.” Three days later, he premiered Applying Pressure: The Off-Season, a succinct documentary about the album’s creative process and concept.\n\nLater that day, it was announced that Cole had signed a deal to play with Rwanda’s Patriots BBC in the Basketball Africa League. This seemed to be the intentional culmination of Cole’s storied work on developing a basketball career, so his reignited journey in the sport correlates directly to the idea and concept of The Off-Season.\n\nOn the 11th, Cole was officially unveiled as the first solo artist to grace the cover of SLAM magazine. In his cover interview, Cole spoke on a few aspects of his life and explained the concepts of both this LP and its successor, The Fall Off.\n\nOn the 13th, eight hours before its release, Cole revealed the album’s tracklist and producer list. Upon the album’s release, it was unveiled that it featured vocal contributions from 21 Savage, Bas, Morray, 6LACK, Cam'ron, and Lil Baby, amongst others. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole/The+Off-Season">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3503 `Van Weezer is the fifteenth studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on May 7, 2021 by Crush Music and Atlantic Records. Featuring a classic rock and hard rock inspired sound, the album was announced in September 2019 with an original release date of May 2020, coinciding with announcement of the band's participation in the Hella Mega Tour alongside Green Day and Fall Out Boy. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was delayed indefinitely and Van Weezer's release was delayed until May 2021, almost four months after the release of the band's previous album OK Human.\n\nFour singles were released ahead of the album's release; "The End of the Game", "Hero", "Beginning of the End" and "I Need Some of That". The album received generally positive reviews from critics. It debuted at number 22 on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 18,600. It reached its peaked at number 11 on the chart.\n\nIn February 2019, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo began working on new songs with a hard rock influence, in contrast to the pop rock and electropop sound that had been featured on the band's previous albums Pacific Daydream, the Teal Album, and the then-upcoming Black Album. In an interview that month with Entertainment Weekly, Cuomo mentioned that an album tentatively titled Van Weezer was in the works, and that it would take the band "back to big guitars". He remarked that when the band would perform "Beverly Hills" live in concert, he would perform a guitar solo that was not present on the recorded version of the song. "We noticed that, recently, the crowd just goes crazy when I do that. So it feels like maybe the audience is ready for some shredding again."\n\nThe album has been compared to their fourth studio album Maladroit (2002), and is inspired by 1970s and 1980s hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Kiss, Black Sabbath, Metallica and Van Halen (the last of whom inspired the album's title). Cuomo would also state that the album is "Blue Album-ish, but a little more riffy."\n\nOn September 10, 2019, the first single from Van Weezer, "The End of the Game" was released along with an announcement that the album would be released on May 15, 2020. The announcement coincided with the revelation of the Hella Mega Tour, a 2020 concert tour featuring Weezer, Green Day, and Fall Out Boy. On May 6, 2020, the second single "Hero" was released onto streaming services; while Weezer announced that the album release would be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that despite this fans would receive "surprises" within the next week. A short snippet of "Blue Dream" debuted on The Simpsons episode "The Hateful Eight-Year-Olds", on which Weezer guest starred as themselves. On August 14, 2020, the band announced that the album had been delayed to May 2021 in order to coincide with the rescheduled Hella Mega Tour. That same day, the third single, "Beginning of the End" was released as a part of the soundtrack for Bill & Ted Face the Music. \n\nOn October 6, 2020, after Eddie Van Halen died, the album was dedicated to him. The track listing was announced on April 20, 2021, and the fourth single, "I Need Some of That" was released the following day.\n\nVan Weezer was released just three-and-a-half months after its predecessor OK Human.\n\nVan Weezer received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67 based on 17 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weezer/Van+Weezer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3497 `If I Could Make It Go Quiet (stylized in all lowercase) is the debut studio album by Norwegian musician Girl in Red. It was released independently through AWAL and her own World in Red label on 30 April 2021, after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was primarily produced by the musician herself alongside Matias Tellez, and features additional work from artists such as Finneas O'Connell.\n\nSonically, it is promised to be a more "ambitious", "mature" and "developed" continuation of the musician's previous bedroom pop and indie rock musical style established in the early EPs Chapter 1 (2018) and Chapter 2 (2019). Lyrically, the singer has described the record as an "emotional recap" of the year 2020 in which she explores her personal mental health experiences as well as "the different sides of love".\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, Girl in Red began continuously teasing and hinting at the phrase "World in Red". She told Billboard in September 2019 that this would be the title of her debut album which would be released in October 2020, and that 2020 would be her year of "world domination", but this plan was spoiled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the music industry. She told NME in April 2020, that " ain't gonna stop World In Red, baby!" In June 2020, the single "Midnight Love" was released as the lead single and first taste from what was then deemed Girl in Red's debut album. "Rue" was released as the second single in August 2020. "Serotonin" was released as the third single soon after the album's announcement on social media in early March 2021. The official album cover was revealed with this announcement to be a painting by Norwegian artist Fredrik Wiig Sørensen. "Serotonin" premiered as Irish DJ Annie Mac's Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1, where Girl in Red herself deemed it "the biggest track  ever put out" and "the best track  has ever written or produced.\n\n1.\t"Serotonin"\n2.\t"Did You Come?"\t \t\n3.\t"Body and Mind"\t \n4.\t"Hornylovesickmess"\t \n5.\t"Midnight Love"\t \t\n6.\t"You Stupid Bitch"\t\n7.\t"Rue"\t \t\n8.\t"Apartment 402"\t \t\n9.\t"."\n10.\t"I'll Call You Mine"\t \t\n11.\t"It Would Feel Like This\n\nAll tracks are written by Marie Ulven. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/girl+in+red/if+i+could+make+it+go+quiet">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3494 `After almost 7 years of emotional struggle, creative drought, and family illness, Porter Robinson's sophomore album, Nurture, released on April 23rd, 2021.\n\nOn January 28, 2020, Robinson's social media announced his sophomore album, Nurture. The album features vocals that are artificially pitched up to sound feminine. After the release of the lead single, "Get Your Wish", Porter explained that the lyrics were about his struggle to create and be proud of the music he was writing, due to suffering from depression. In a letter to his fans, he detailed how he used to struggle with writing music, and how he overcame that struggle. "I realized I shouldn't write music with the expectation that the productivity or achievement will fix my problems, but instead with the hope that my honest expression will move people the way music moves me. So when I was really struggling to write and it seemed impossible, instead of thinking, 'You're struggling because you're a fraud, you're clearly not cut out for this,' I began to tell myself, 'Yeah, this is what you sacrifice.'"\n\nIn January the following year, after the album experienced delays from COVID-19, Robinson announced via Twitter that the album would be released that year, via Mom+Pop records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Porter+Robinson/Nurture">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3490 'Michigan Boy Boat is Lil Yachty’s third commercial mixtape and the follow-up to his November 2020 release, Lil Boat 3.5. The Michigan-themed record is nearly two years in the making.\n\nMichigan Boy Boat is derived from Lil Yachty’s love for and deep connection to the rap scenes of both Detroit and Flint, Michigan. The tape is essentially a collaborative record between Yachty and several of the state’s brightest upcoming rappers.\n\nAside from Tee Grizzley, one of Detroit’s biggest stars and Yachty’s frequent collaborator, Lil Boat calls on many of the states underground and lesser known talent, including KrispyLife Kidd, Louie Ray, BabyTron, Rio da Yung OG, RMC Mike, Sada Baby, YN Jay, Babyface Ray, Veeze, and Baby Smoove. The only non-Michigan native on the mixtape is Swae Lee.\n\nYachty first teased the concept of this project in a tweet on June 9, 2019, claiming that it would drop before Lil Boat 3. However, LB3 was delayed until May 2020; as a result, the Detroit-themed tape was indefinitely delayed.\n\nYachty revived the idea of the Michigan-themed tape on October 19, 2020, coinciding with the YouTube release of his Sada Baby collaboration, “Not Regular.”\n\nYachty surprise-announced Michigan Boy Boat on April 21, 2021, less than two days before its release, alongside its official artwork and a teaser trailer.\n\nOn the day of the mixtape’s release, Boat released The Boat Show Season 2 Episode 7, which is Part 1 of a documentary of MBB’s creative process.\n\nYachty’s connection to Michigan officially began with his March 2017 Tee Grizzley collaboration, “From the D to the A.” Over the next four years, Yachty built a strong rapport with several of the state’s underground rappers, collaborating with many of them. The mutual respect culminated in the release of this unifying mixtape. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Yachty/Michigan+Boy+Boat">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3479 `Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine (often abbreviated to ROADRUNNER) is the sixth studio album by American hip-hop boy band Brockhampton. The album was released on April 9, 2021, through RCA and Question Everything, and received generally positive reviews from music critics.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Brockhampton released songs on their YouTube channel every weekend, and would sometimes livestream on Twitch and Instagram. During these streams, Brockhampton would play unreleased music, with some songs releasing shortly after the end of some streams. The series was abruptly canceled, and in September 2020, Brockhampton producer Romil Hemnani revealed in an interview that the album's initials were RR, leaving fans to believe that the album was titled Roadrunner. The title was later confirmed, and the album's full title, Roadrunner, New Light: New Machine, was announced shortly after the release of the lead single "Buzzcut". Brockhampton recorded three different versions of Roadrunner and chose one for the final cut of the album. Kevin Abstract revealed on Twitter that Roadrunner was the first of " Brockhampton albums  in 2021", later clarifying that the upcoming albums will be Brockhampton's final releases. The second album was later delayed to 2022, though on January 14, 2022, Brockhampton announced an indefinite hiatus following their Coachella performance in April 2022. That album, The Family, was announced on October 27, 2022, and officially released on November 17, 2022.\n\nPrior to the album's release, one member of Brockhampton, Joba, commented that the lyrics of Roadrunner contains themes that are very personal to the members, including the suicide of Joba's father. Kevin Abstract noted that there would be lyrics about his sexuality on the record.\n\nAfter the album was released, Abstract announced via TikTok that a deluxe edition of the album was to be released soon. The Plus Pack edition of the album was released on June 4, 2021, including four new songs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/BROCKHAMPTON/ROADRUNNER:+NEW+LIGHT,+NEW+MACHINE">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3475 `"I have spent the past year researching a lost tradition of my hilltop birthplace called 'Lei Music.' This special genre has the ability to summon strange, squeaking entities from invisible zones. These songs are transcribed to special discs called 'Lei Disks' - and are now hoarded & traded obsessively by modern-day collectors.\n\n\nThere is no clear explanation of why the performance of Lei Music has such extraordinary effects. Some believe it could be related to a variety of properties unique to Dorset - such as the high concentration of towering granite artefacts, floating pebble circles, and nearby landmarks’ alignments with otherworldly phenomena. The musical instruments that were traditionally played are suspected to have stimulated geoglyphic ley lines - and inadvertently operated as tools that created small rifts between worlds.\n\n\nI have been working very hard on a new album of modern laptop-based Lei Music, and have been summoning lots of different clattering, shifting and clicking entities. I am excited to show you them very soon. ⛢꧂" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iglooghost/Lei+Line+Eon">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3473 '“From Me To You” is Quadeca’s fifth album, released March 30, 2021. However, there were a lot of delays and events between the announcement and the release of the album.\n\nIn Quad’s music video for his September 2019 single, “SCHOENBERG” with Moxas, an announcement was made that it would drop early 2020. However, the album was heavily delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic halting production. The album was first announced on Quadeca’s Twitter with the hashtag, #FMTY. A $500 reward was given to whoever guessed the acronym correctly.\n\nThe album was preceded by two singles; the first being titled “Where’d You Go?,” being released on April 8th, 2020, and the second being “Alone Together,” which was released on April 29th, 2020. The production debuted a very drastic change in his style compared to the last album.\n\nOn the last full week of January 2021, Quad changed his Twitter name to “🏔️🏔️…” and each day of that week, Quad removed one character day by day. When the final day arrived on January 29, and one mountain emoji was left, Quad released the official announcement for the album titled From Me To You – Quadeca. A video featuring the background instrumental of “Summit, Pt. 2 (Outro).” He showed clips from his recording process of the album and announced the album would drop on March 18, 2021.\n\nHowever, on March 8th, the album was pushed back to March 31st, and Quad announced he would drop a single on the 18th instead. He also revealed the tracklist of the album with three features, IDK, PlayThatBoiZay, and Guapdad 4000. Quad also revealed that aside from 3 tracks, all of the other 15 tracks were 100% produced by himself. In the Quadeca community, a large stir was caused as earlier that day, a fan had used Shazam to leak most of the track names. Many people assumed Quad had delayed the album and released the tracklist because of this leak. However, Quad confirmed that this was not the case and that he just got neurotic planning everything out and needed more time.\n\nTwo days before release, the single was revealed to be “Sisyphus,” Quad’s favorite track off of the album. However, due to issues with streaming services, Sisyphus was delayed. The music video released on March 20 and the official version went to streaming services on March 24. The track was met with highly positive reviews from people like Anthony Fantano, who had actually previously criticized Quad’s music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Quadeca/From+Me+To+You">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3463 'Acting as the sequel to Benny’s June 2019 EP The Plugs I Met, The Plugs I Met 2 continues the theme of using visuals from the 1983 crime film Scarface and, this time around, is entirely produced by Harry Fraud.\n\nThe Buffalo rapper described how the process of making the album went between himself and the New York-born producer:\n\n"Hit-Boy’s process was a little similar to Harry’s, but it’s little small differences. It might be from how many blunts we smoke or what we do before we start recording to what we do after. With Harry, the vibe was always right. We get in there, we order a bunch of food, we smoke and we talking, we laughing, people were even playing 2K. In the middle of all that, I’m just sitting back and crafting words. I know the prestigious things Harry worked on, and I’m just trying to live up to that."\n\nHe went on to talk about getting a posthumous Chinx verse:\n\n"Harry came up with the idea, he had a Chinx verse that he had, he was like yo, what you think about if I do that? I was like that would be crazy. And it came out like we were in the studio together. I don’t know what time that verse was from, but I know it fit perfectly." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Benny+the+Butcher/The+Plugs+I+Met+2">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Callinan)—Smiling with No Teeth debuted at number 27 on the ARIA Albums Chart.\n\nAt the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, the album won Album of the Year, Best Hip-Hop Release, and Best Independent Release while Andrew Klippel and Dave Hammer won the ARIA Award for Producer of the Year. Owusu was nominated for Best Artist and Kofi Anash & Bailey Howard were nominated for Best Cover Art.\n\nAt the J Awards of 2021, the album won the Australian Album of the Year and in March 2022, won the Australian Music Prize and Best Record at the 2022 Rolling Stone Australia Awards. At the AIR Awards of 2022, it won Independent Album of the Year.\n\nSmiling with No Teeth received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86 based on six reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". The aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.1 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nMark Salisbury of Earmilk praised the album, saying that it "is a visceral sonic attack on the senses and should cement Genesis Owusu as an international renaissance man". Mike Vinti of Loud and Quiet said, "A triumph from top to bottom, Smiling with No Teeth sets the stage for Genesis Owusu to become a potentially generation-defining star". John Murphy of musicOMH said, "it's an album that's easy to feel intimidated by at first listen, due to its sheer scale and ambition. However, after a few listens you'll be in no doubt that Genesis Owusu is one of the most exciting names of the year". Steven Loftin of The Line of Best Fit said, "Owusu's debut offering not only manages to deftly balance style with substance, but does so with a jubilance that gives as much reason to curl up your own most toothy grin". Simone Ziaziaris of The Sydney Morning Herald said, "via forays into multiple musical genres, Smiling with No Teeth creates a space both for Owusu to express his own personal experiences, and for others to question nuanced complexities". Jenessa Williams of DIY said, "like Gorillaz, Outkast or even The Weeknd before him, he plays well with dark and sinister, throwing theatrical voice in a musical hall of mirrors with real versatility". Cyclone Wehner of NME said, "with Smiling With No Teeth, Genesis Owusu has delivered a riveting album that underscores the power of self-knowledge, perspective and art – one that should be cranked loud". Thomas H Green of The Arts Desk found that the album "brings to mind an overdose of references, but the musical magpie-ism is more Prince than pastiche". Rachel Brodsky of The Independent said, "with strong, clear-eyed subtext, overlaid by compositions that touch on every influence from TV on the Radio to Prince, Childish Gambino and Radiohead, Smiling With No Teeth is not so much an album as it is a memoir". Sofie Lindevall of Gigwise said that the album "has plenty of not only good, but great, songs and whether you are a fan of high energy hip-hop, raw punk-esque guitars or soulful R&B, there is something on the album for you".\n\nSmiling with No Teeth debuted and peaked at number 27 on the ARIA Albums Chart for the chart dated 15 March 2021. The album also debuted at number 3 on the ARIA Top 20 Vinyl Albums Chart, and at number 5 on the ARIA Top 20 Australian Albums Chart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Genesis+Owusu/Smiling+with+No+Teeth">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3419 `OK Human is the fourteenth studio album by Weezer. In contrast to typical Weezer releases, the album features no electric guitar, utilizing exclusively analogue equipment and a 38-piece orchestra.\n\nIt was released on January 29, 2021. Physical copies were initially exclusive to the official web store and would see wide release on February 12.\n\n\nProduction and composition\nRivers Cuomo has credited producer Jake Sinclair with planting "the seed of an idea" for OK Human in 2017. "Just you and a piano, and an orchestra, and it's gonna be super-personal, quirky songs that only you could write, not worrying about commercial potential at all, adding that Sinclair suggested he listen to the 1970 album Nilsson Sings Newman by Harry Nilsson. Cuomo had previously covered the Nilsson tune "Without You," originally written by members of the '70s band Badfinger. Cuomo said that he was excited from day one of the creative process for OK Human, and that the songs came quickly thereafter, with the album being "about 90% done" before he was made aware of the forthcoming Hella Mega Tour.\n\nEarly promotion\nCuomo first confirmed the album's existence to Zane Lowe in January of 2019. Said Cuomo: "Our next album is not on the grid, we’ve just recorded the basic tracks there’s no click, no grid. We don’t have a real title, but the key word we have to inspire us at the moment is ‘masterpiece’. It’s produced by Jake Sinclair who did the White Album." Cuomo first mentioned the album's working title "OK Human" in an interview with the Los Angeles Times published on February 22, 2019, about a week before the release of The Black Album. Cuomo described the album as "piano-based, very eccentric, with strings already recorded at Abbey Road." Cuomo mentioned that his influences for the album were George Gershwin and Harry Nilsson (specifically, Nilsson Sings Newman). Cuomo also confirmed the existence of another project tentatively titled Van Weezer.\n\nIn a July 2019 interview with All Things Loud, Brian Bell described the album as being "about technology and how it’s running our life". Said Bell:\nOK Human is unlike anything I’ve ever heard, unlike any other type of music and unlike any Weezer music. In the bass, if you really broke it down to its common denominator, it still goes one, four, five in a major key for the most part. That’s very Weezer, that’s very Sweater Song, but it does it in more sophisticated ways.\nIn an interview with Spanish magazine Mondo Sonoro, Bell described the basis of the album as "a string section", and that the album would also feature acoustic guitars, a Hammond organ, and would sound very "airy and open". Bell also described the album as one of his favorite albums the band has made thus far. In an August 2019 interview with the Spanish blog Binaural, Bell confirmed that the album's string section was recorded before anything else, and suggested that Crush Management would prefer to release Van Weezer before OK Human. Bell, Patrick Wilson, and Scott Shriner sing three-part harmonies through most of the record. Originating in Bell's backing vocal compositions, the trio singing pieces were arranged and further developed by Jake Sinclair. Bell described the process in a February 8, 2021 interview with 91.9 WFPK Louisville, Kentucky:\n\n\nI would sing ideas, like, "here’s my ideas," and- I didn’t realize how good Jake Sinclair was at vocal harmonies. He would come back and three-part almost everything I did. And he wanted the other guys to sing it, meaning Scott and Pat. I’ve always wanted to get Pat to sing a lot more.\n\n- Brian Bell, WFPK interview; February 8, 2021\nSinclair produced vocal tracks of all three parts which were used for the sessions. "I just really believed in this album and I wanted to push to get it done," Bell said.\n\nThe vocals were intended to enhance the "human element" of the record, which the band emphasized in most press materials about OK Human. These vocals are low in the released mix of the album and mixed in mono.\n\nRelease schedule change\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hella Mega Tour was postponed until 2021. On April 10, 2020, Cuomo stated on the video conferencing platform Zoom that, at the time, the album was 75% complete. He followed this up by stating the album would likely not be released in 2020. On April 16, he explained the premise to a fan as "very much a day in the life of , but from a very private place." On May 14, Cuomo shared a photo via Snapchat of a studio, with visible sheet music titled "Dead Roses". On May 15, Cuomo confirmed in an interview with Mike Jones of the radio station DC101 that the string section was the first to be recorded for the album and that, at the time of the interview, only his piano parts were yet to be completed.\n\nOn August 13, Weezer formally announced that Van Weezer was being postponed until May 2021, simultaneously hinting that OK Human would release in the meantime, tweeting "More music coming for you Hum
 3414 '"BRASS" is a collaborative album from experimental musician and poet Moor Mother and the rapper billy woods (½ of Armand Hammer). After working together on Armand Hammer’s critically acclaimed 2020 LP "Shrines", Moor Mother and woods released the song “Furies” for the Adult Swim single series in July. A whirl of interweaving allegories spun over producer Willie Green’s hypnotic flip of a Sons of Kmet sample, “Furies” was the burning arrow that both artists followed, the first crack of thunder in a blackening sky.\n\n"BRASS" sees both artists joined by an eclectic array of friends, family, and legends- in some cases all three. John Forte, ELUCID, Amirtha Kidambi, Franklin James Fisher (Algiers), Mach Hommy, Imani Robinson, Wolf Weston (Saint Mela), Navy Blue, and Fielded all lend their voices to the project. Production by The Alchemist, Preservation, Moor Mother, Olof Melander, Child Actor, Navy Blue, Messiah Muzik, Steel Tipped Dove, and WIllie Green.\n\n"BRASS" is a moment where two great artists in their own right tap into a new frequency together. Even for those familiar with both it’s an unexpected sound that, once heard, could never have been otherwise. It is both ethereal and utilitarian, timeless and timeworn. A cast-iron pot propped over a fire in the dark. A tropical beach shimmering with broken glass. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Moor+Mother/BRASS">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 3403 `Whole Lotta Red is the sophomore studio album by the American rapper Playboi Carti, released on December 25th, 2020, through Interscope Records. The album title was discovered on August 18, 2018, when a recording of Carti surfaced, in which he was conversing about the project. The title refers to Carti’s affiliation with the Bloods, as well as his affinity for Wockhardt’s red codeine-promethazine syrup, commonly known as lean.\n\nIn a Spring 2019 GQ story published on March 4, Carti named fashion designer and art director Virgil Abloh as the creative director of the album.\n\nIn The FADER’s Summer 2019 cover story featuring Carti which was published on June 12, it was revealed that some tracks recorded during the production of the album had guest appearances from Trippie Redd and Gunna, with production from Pi'erre Bourne, Maaly Raw, Richie Souf, Roark Bailey, and Don Cannon.\n\nDuring his performance at The Rave / Eagles Club on July 28, 2019, Carti announced that he was trying to release the album within the following sixty days with no guest appearances:\n\n"I’m trying to drop that shit in the next 60 days. I ain’t gon' lie, it feel like we worked too hard for this moment so I'ma do this shit with no features."\n\nIn an interview with Culture Kings released on January 15, 2020, Carti updated the planned release date to 2020 and that the project aims to prove Carti’s skills in bullshitting:\n\n"I’m ready. I’m more ready than y'all. I’m trying to prove to these folks that I can’t rap. I got bars. That’s what Whole Lotta Red is about."\n\n“@ MEH” was released as a single for the album on April 16, 2020. But the track was later scrapped due to bad reviews on the song from critics.\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Carti shared on Instagram that the album had been turned in to his label.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, DJ Akademiks said during a live stream that Kanye West and Matthew Williams were executive producers of the album. Moreover, he shared that the album would drop on Christmas Day, which was later confirmed by some of Carti’s associates on December 14, 2020. Red graffiti tags subsequently surfaced around the United States with the album's release date.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, Carti revealed the cover artwork and official Christmas Day release date through social media.\n\nWhole Lotta Red debuted at No. 1 on US Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews, but the album later started to gain appreciation from critics and now is considered a groundbreaking album of the aggressive hip-hop/rap genre. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti/Whole+Lotta+Red">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3398 `The Downward Spiral (also known as Halo 8) is the third major release by American Industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails, released in 1994 on Reznor's own Nothing Records (a vanity label of Interscope Records). "Halo 8" of the official Nine Inch Nails halo releases, it is a concept album detailing the destruction of an undisclosed man; from the beginning to his climactic suicide. The album was a major commercial success that secured Nine Inch Nails as a force in the 1990s music scene, in particular following the release of the single "Closer" and its controversial video.\n\nTo record the album, Reznor rented the house located at 10050 Cielo Drive in Beverly Hills, California where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969. Reznor built a studio space in the house which he named Le Pig, after the message that was scrawled on the front door with Tate's blood by her murderers. Reznor told Entertainment Weekly that despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because, "I looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most." Reznor moved out of the house in December 1993, after he said "there was too much history in that house for me to handle." After the album's recording, Trent Reznor consulted with the landlords and had the house demolished shortly after.\n\nReznor made a statement about working in the Tate house during a 1997 interview with Rolling Stone:\n\n“ While I was working on Downward Spiral, I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: 'Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, 'No, it's just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred.' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don't want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, 'What if it was my sister?' I thought, 'Fuck Charlie Manson.' I went home and cried that night. It made me see there's another side to things, you know? ” \n\nReznor set out to make an album that was a departure from the 1992 Broken EP, emphasizing "mood, texture, restraint and subtlety." He brought in a number of guest performers to record, including former Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros drummer Stephen Perkins and progressive rock guitarist Adrian Belew. Perkins played a number of drum parts that were recorded live in the studio; these tracks were in turn turned into sample loops. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts. Reznor would record 20 to 25-minute long sessions of himself playing guitar on a hard disc recorder with a Studio Vision sequencer, then would cut out parts of the recording he found interesting for later use. Reznor said, "99 percent of the stuff we do–even vocals–is recorded into the computer  first. We get an arrangement together and then dump it to tape." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/The+Downward+Spiral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3396 `The classic Roots LP that is perhaps their best loved work and it's easy to see why. It has litle of the difficult lyrics and dark music of later genius like Game Theory and is not too experimental for the more narrow minded hip hop fans like Phrenology was. Updating the live jazzy sound of earlier work and introducing ever improving songwriting and a fine use of guests of some renown, Common, Mos Def and Dice Raw all add something to the record. It is the mighty Erykah Badu who steals the show on the guest front though with her contribution on the records best known track "You Got Me". A hip hop classic that started to show what a great band The Roots are and continue to be. I would say if you are looking to start a Roots collection this is where I would start as a best example of the core sound of the band. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Roots/Things+Fall+Apart">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on December 11, 2020, through Republic Records, less than five months after the singer's eighth studio album, folklore.\n\nevermore was a spontaneous product of Swift's extended collaboration with her folklore co-producer Aaron Dessner, with whom she developed a creative chemistry and could not stop writing songs even after releasing the latter.\n\nSwift described evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods"—an escapist, cottagecore-inspired direction she first ideated with folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic; she regards them as sister albums. evermore blends alternative rock, indie folk and chamber pop styles, carried by fingerpicked guitars, somber pianos, lavish strings, and sparse percussion. Impressionist storytelling and mythopoeia dominate its lyrical technique. The subject matter has been described as an anthology of tales about love, marriage, infidelity, and grief, exploring the complexities of human emotion. American bands Bon Iver, HAIM, and The National appear as guest performers on the album.\n\nEarning widespread acclaim from critics, evermore was praised for its character studies, experimental production, and Swift's nuanced vocals. Reviews regarded the album a sequel or a counterpart to folklore, and various publications listed it in their 2020 year-end rankings. evermore was nominated for Album of the Year at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, a second consecutive nomination for Swift in the category after winning it with folklore the previous year.

3387 `Man on the Moon III: The Chosen is the seventh studio album by American rapper Kid Cudi. It was released on December 11, 2020, by Republic Records. Announced on December 7, 2020, it is the final installment of Cudi's Man on the Moon trilogy of albums (which includes 2009's Man on the Moon: The End of Day and 2010's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager). The 18-track album features guest appearances from Pop Smoke, Skepta, Phoebe Bridgers and Trippie Redd. Production was handled by many high-profile producers, such as Cudi himself and Dot da Genius, who serve as executive producers, along with Plain Pat, Emile Haynie, and Mike Dean, all of whom contributed to the previous two Man on the Moon albums.\n\nMusically, the album's theme finds Cudi fight against his evil alter ego, Mr. Rager, in hopes to win back his peace and happiness. As with the previous two installments, the album is split into four "acts": Return 2 Madness; The Rager, The Menace; Heart of Rose Gold; and Powers.\n\nThe continuation of Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon trilogy was first teased in his July 2020 collaboration with Eminem, "The Adventures of Moon Man & Slim Shady", in which Cudi raps on the outro, "The trilogy continues". Cudi officially confirmed Man on the Moon III in October 2020, releasing a trailer with the caption, "The trilogy continues... soon". In November, he tweeted, "The music is coming. I promise". On December 7, 2020, he released a cinematic trailer, revealing the title, release date, tracklist, and the cover art, designed by Sam Spratt. Music videos will be released for the songs "Heaven on Earth" and "She Knows This", the latter a day before the album's release; both videos were directed by Nabil.\n\nAccording to Cudi, the album is, as with all his releases, "nothing" like any of his previous works:\n"My first 2 albums were meant to be untopped. I didn't even think Id live to make another record after motm 2... My point is, u cant top timeless. And that was what we aim for everytime".\n\nIn addition, the synopsis on the album's back cover reads:\n"In the last 10 years, Scott Mescudi  has been through hell and back. After feeling like his world was over, he found hope and overcame the darkness that was plaguing his life. But happiness isn't forever. What he thought was peace turns into a nightmare. He finds himself lost dealing with the same pain he had not felt in years. In one night, he must face himself again and fight to win back his soul from the evil Mr. Rager".\n\nThe album features production from Cudi’s longtime collaborators Dot da Genius, Emile Haynie, Plain Pat and Mike Dean, all of whom helped shape the sound for the first two installments of the Man on the Moon series. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Cudi explained that he was encouraged by his protégé, Houston-based rapper Travis Scott to be more lyrical and made a concerted effort to showcase his skill set as a rapper on this album since he feels he’s overlooked in that aspect of his artistry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Cudi/Man+on+the+Moon+III:+The+Chosen">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

More than any other work since The Disintegration Loops, there is an ominous grief throughout the album, and that sense of loss lingers like an emotional vapor. \n\nCaptured and constructed from tape loops and studies from Basinski’s archives – dating back to 1979 – Lamentations is over forty years of mournful sighs meticulously crafted into songs. They are shaped by the inevitable passage of time and the indisputable collapsing of space – and their collective resonance is infinite and eternal. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/William+Basinski/Lamentations">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3357 `Magic Oneohtrix Point Never is the ninth studio album by American electronic producer Daniel Lopatin, under his alias Oneohtrix Point Never, released on October 30, 2020, via Warp. The album draws on a psychedelic radio aesthetic strongly inspired by Magic 106.7, the mondegreen namesake of Lopatin's project, and was recorded during COVID-19 lockdowns, between March and July 2020.\n\nIt is the second album to heavily feature Lopatin's own vocals after Age Of, with a higher focus on songwriting. It features collaborations with The Weeknd (who also served as an executive producer for the album), Caroline Polachek, Arca and Nolanberollin.

Upon release, Magic Oneohtrix Point Never was met with critical acclaim and was featured on several publications' year-end lists.\n\nMagic Oneohtrix Point Never was conceived as an album in early 2020 after Lopatin created eclectically varied mixtapes for the Safdie brothers' radio site Elara Radio; overall, he found that "on a therapeutic scale", he "always enjoyed the comfort of listening to the radio, and of listening to people have inane discussions on podcasts". Lopatin remarked to GQ that "there's so much of me on this—even the collaborations are appropriate ". In comparison, the album is themed around a psychedelic radio aesthetic and features four "Cross Talk" interludes, collages of "archival recordings of various American FM stations' "format flips", in which detourned DJ sign-offs collide with advertisements and self-help mantras", marking each periodic stage of the album.\n\nLopatin said of his intent with creating Magic Oneohtrix Point Never that:\n\n"I wanted to make a cohesive, punchy, 50-minute record that was very personal, but pulled from FM palettes that I was personally interested in  I think it works really well as a metaphor for how I've changed. The things that I try to understand about my own life and being an avid musical listener and how much that's influenced me as a musician is kind of apparent on this record. That metaphor of transformation is something that I came to by thinking about the radio."\n\nThe press release issued by Warp upon the album's announcement, especially concerning the album's concept, tone and use of textures, stated that it "loosely summons the broadcasting logic of radio dayparts, switching on in the morning and closing very late at night, while seamlessly latticed together with kaleidoscopic, twitchy transformations of sound between the dials to form a darkly humorous reflection on American music culture", concluding by referring to the album's style as "maximalist baroque-pop within atmospheric glitter".\n\nLopatin began teasing the album on September 22, 2020, posting a video teaser stating the album title to social media platforms. He announced the album and its tracklist on September 25; the announcement also came with the release of the "Drive Time Suite", a single release consisting of the first three songs off of the album: "Cross Talk I", "Auto & Allo" and "Long Road Home".\n\nOn October 14, Lopatin released the music video for "Long Road Home", co-directed by Charlie Fox and Emily Schubert. The stopmotion animated video pays homage to the 1982 short film Le Ravissement de Frank N. Stein, which was also adapted on Lopatin's 2013 Oneohtrix Point Never album, R Plus Seven. On October 27, Lopatin released the "Midday Suite", another single release containing the next 5 tracks of the album, "Cross Talk II", "I Don't Love Me Anymore", "Bow Ecco", "The Whether Channel" and "No Nightmares". Lopatin also shared the personnel for the album on the same day to social media. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Oneohtrix+Point+Never/Magic+Oneohtrix+Point+Never">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3354 'Bring Me The Horizon’s first record after 2019’s amo, Post Human: Survival Horror is part of a four EP project. The first record is the heaviest one and it brings back the style of the band’s first records. As Oli Sykes said to Music Feeds:\n\n"It’s kind of a mix, just like you’ve heard on “Parasite Eve,” where it still feels bonkers in terms of jumping from genre to genre and sound to sound, but we’ve definitely took a little bit more influence from things we did quite a few years ago. Whereas now we’ve got something to be angry about, we’ve got something to be pissed about, we’ve got something to make violent music to."\n\nThe word “Posthuman” or “Post-human” is a word that originates from futurology that means a person or entity that exists in a state beyond what we know as a “human.” While the exact meaning of the word varies, it is generally considered to be a person who through either genetic manipulation or other biointerventionist measures, has the ability to remain healthy and active through an extended period of time that would not be considered normal by our current standards. Their cognitive powers, such as deductive thought or other intellectual capabilities, would far surpass those of a simple human.\n\n"The idea behind Post Human is looking at how we’ve stepped out of evolution and the food chain. If we can do that, then we can take responsibility for what we’ve done to the planet and become something better than what humans are right now."\n\n—Oli Sykes, NME\n\nEvery part of this project is sonically different and have a different message. This first album expresses all the anger inside people and is “a recruitment record with battle songs,” as Oli explains:\n\n"You know like on Lord of the Rings where they all sing a song before battle, knowing that they might die but they’re going got persevere and see how it goes? We’re trying to embody that. This first record is about hope and anger and feels like the sonic equivalent of a riot. We’re inviting people to find the solution with us. It’s a demonstration to pull you in and get your back up. It’s a lot more aggressive than anything we’ve done for a while. The world doesn’t need light-hearted pop music right now—it needs anthems for anger. There’s so much to be pissed off about."\n\nThe band needed a cyberpunk feeling to the album, so they decided to call Mick Gordon, DOOM Eternal’s musical producer.\n\n"I’ve been playing this one game called DOOM Eternal and as I was playing it I absolutely fell in love with the soundtrack. It’s fucking crazy. It’s heavy as fuck. It’s got this kind of dystopian cyber-punky djent kind of fucking huge vibe. A guy called Mick Gordon actually produced all this music. At first, when we were writing “Parasite Eve” especially I was referencing a lot of this DOOM game ‘cause I was playing it in the day and then me and Jordan would work at night and I was like using this as references because the sounds in there sound so huge and so hitting in a way I haven’t heard in any other metal music. And then it kind of dawned on me that like, you know, maybe this is the guy we’re looking for to collaborate with. So I hit him up. Amazingly, he got back to us and said he was a massive fan of the band and really loved what we did and would love to work with us. So I started talking to him, we got chatting, I told him my ideas and wrote him a bunch of notes and basically just left the song with him and he came back with a fucking sound library. So he added textures and tunings to the vocals and shit like that really kind of just pushes it further to make you feel what we are trying to get across. So yeah, he smashed it basically and I’m really stoked on how that turned out. I think we’re going to be working with him more on this record."\n\n—Oli Sykes, BMTH Season 2’s “Mick Gordon” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bring+Me+the+Horizon/POST+HUMAN:+SURVIVAL+HORROR">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3350 `"Pixel Bath" is the debut studio album from Los Angeles based artist Jean Dawson. The album was released October 23, 2020. Featuring a whole host of collaborators both old (Lecx Stacy, Hoskins) and new (A$AP Rocky, Jim-E Stack, Gabe Wax), Pixel Bath touches on themes of belonging, power, and death. Be it garage rock delivery over 2000's alt-pop production ("Devilish"), synthwave homages ("Shiner"), or a brief foray into industrial rap ("06 Burst"), Dawson is relentless in tugging at the common threads between seemingly distinct genres, determined to see what happens when it all unravels.\n\n"Pixel Bath" puts Dawson's command over catchy melodies on full display, particularly on cuts like "Bruiseboy" and "Starface*." "Bruiseboy," which was released as a single back in February, is a manic journey through the twilight zone between imagination and reality. The common link between each song is the unwavering resolve with which Dawson stares down his demons. The devil takes several forms throughout the project. On "Clear Bones," it's the Grim Reaper. On "Pegasus" and Bandcamp Day special release "Policia," it's the threat of state-sponsored violence. At times, it's the naysayers, and at others, himself.\n\nRegardless, Dawson stands his ground in the face of the various bogeymen. The avant-popstar says it best on "Power Freaks:" "I know they don't want smoke with me / Play dead, pussy boy, get ate." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jean+Dawson/PIXEL+BATH">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3339 `Róisín Machine is the fifth solo studio album by Irish singer Róisín Murphy, released on 2 October 2020 by Skint Records. Simulation was the first track on the record to be made, produced by Richard Barratt (also known as DJ Parrot and Crooked Man), and released in 2012. Jealousy, also produced by Barratt, was released in 2015. Both were released as standalone tracks and did not appear on her subsequent studio album, Hairless Toys, or its successor, 2016's Take Her Up to Monto. Following these releases, Murphy continued to collaborate with Barratt, working in "drips and drabs over the years," releasing Incapable, which was billed as another one-off release, in 2019. (Incapable had in fact been written in 2010, following her breakup from artist Simon Henwood, nine months after their daughter was born.)\n\nA departure from the art pop, trip hop, and bossa nova influences of her previous works, Róisín Machine marks a turn into dance-oriented club music. The album features influences of disco, nu-disco, house, electropop, funk, post-disco, electro-R&B, Chicago house, dub, wonky pop, and minimal funk. The album's songs reject traditional pop structures in a manner similar to vintage disco 12-inch singles. Critical reception was very positive, and the album entered the UK charts at #14 in October 2020, making it the highest-charting release to date for her solo career. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/R%C3%B3is%C3%ADn+Murphy/R%C3%B3is%C3%ADn+Machine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3338 'Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn) is Jay Electronica’s long-awaited follow-up to Act I, originally slated to release for years before his debut album, A Written Testimony, which was assumed to never release until 2020. On September 20, 2020, a leaker claimed he had found a version of the project from the specific date of September 3, 2012, and he would release it if he was crowdfunded $9,000. Within twelve days, various Jay Electronica fans had completed the funding, and he leaked the album to the public. Jay E’s team was aware of the buy happening and claimed various times within a Discord server that the leak was actually exciting for Jay E, and depending on fan reaction once it leaked, he might officially release it.\n\nWhen the project leaked, Jay E tweeted that he was overwhelmed from all the positive reactions to the project, and his manager even tweeted out a SoundCloud link to the leak. However, it’s important to note that the leaker accidentally leaked the project with a typo in the title: a “The” was written before “Patents” when that was never actually meant to be in the title. The title was always meant to be Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn).\n\nA day after the leak occurred, Jay’s team had uploaded that exact leaked zip onto Tidal, not a mixed and mastered version. They also accidentally left it to include the typo with the extra “The” in the title, just like the leaked zip, so it is now canonically the official title. There have been mixed signals over whether a final mixed and mastered version would be released onto all platforms, but knowing how long this project took to come out, if that is the plan, it likely won’t happen for a long time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Electronica/Act+II:+The+Patents+Of+Nobility+(The+Turn)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3331 `Savage Mode II is a collaborative studio album by Atlanta-based rapper 21 Savage and American record producer Metro Boomin. It was released on October 2, 2020, and was previewed through a trailer with narration by Morgan Freeman. The album serves as a sequel to the duo's extended play Savage Mode (2016). It features guest appearances by Drake, Young Thug, and Savage's cousin Young Nudy. On October 19, 2020, a chopped and screwed version of the album was released.\n\nSavage Mode II received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, becoming 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one album. It was supported by two singles: "Runnin" and "Mr. Right Now".\n\nMetro Boomin first announced the project in July 2019, after 21 Savage brought him out on stage during a concert. Speaking to the crowd, Metro simply stated that Savage Mode II was on the way. On February 18, 2020, the producer tweeted a photo of himself and Savage in the studio. The caption for the picture read "MODE". On March 3, 21 Savage reposted a fan's Instagram story that the project would be released on March 13. In May, Savage stated that they were making sure the album is "perfect" before being released. The project's release was officially announced on September 28, with the duo confirmed the release date and previewing the album with a horror-themed, "macabre" trailer directed by Gibson Hazard, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman; he recorded his contributions onto his iPhone at his home. The visual contains in-studio scenes of the pair, as Freeman informs viewers of the meaning of "savage mode": "'Savage' is defined as 'fierce, beastly and untamed'. 'Mode' is defined as 'a way of operating or using the system'. So to be in 'savage mode' is to go hard, not allowing anything to stop or deter you from your mission. Basically, this means when someone is in 'savage mode', they're not to be fucked with". The announcement came a week after fans launched a petition urging Savage and Metro to release the album. It garnered over 28,000 signatures.\n\nMetro Boomin unveiled the album cover on September 29 on his social media, with the caption: "Boominati Slaughter Gang taking over for the 2020 and the 21", recalling Juvenile's line "Cash Money Records taking over the 99 and the 2000" from his single "Back That Azz Up". The cover was created by Pen & Pixel, who came out of retirement for the design. It is a "nostalgic" and vintage artwork, "heavily" inspired by those of Cash Money and No Limit Records and is a nod to the "bling rap" album covers of the 1990s.\n\nA promotional website for the album was created, featuring a live countdown to the project's release and a phone number that listeners could call to hear snippets of the tracks.\n\nThe music video for the song, "Runnin", was released on October 2, 2020. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on October 13, 2020, as the album's dual lead single, along with "Mr. Right Now", featuring Canadian rapper Drake, which was serviced to urban contemporary radio. The music video for "My Dawg", was released on October 7, 2020.\n\nSavage Mode II was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nIn a positive review, Dhruva Balram of NME wrote that "As a whole, the album is confirmation of two young artists at the top of their game, watching the landscape unfold from the throne they earned themselves four years ago." Robin Murray of Clash praised the "crisp and future-facing" production from Metro Boomin, as well as the rap performances by 21 Savage. He concluded: "Savage Mode 2 matches ruthless entertainment to phenomenal artistry, a collaboration that works on a number of levels." Charles Lyons-Burt of Slant Magazine said, "It's Metro, though, who elevates 21's stories to something approaching greatness. ... This sequel is a ratification of the "bigger and better," an example of steady improvement through impeccable craft." Rashad Grove from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the album, saying, "21 Savage, accompanied by the golden touch of Metro Boomin, have given the hip-hop world their most well-rounded project to date, and they set the bar high for others to measure up to." Paste critic Trey Alston said, "Savage Mode II is a worthy successor to the original, building on that initial moment that made 21 Savage a household name. Adventurous, introspective, and thoughtful, it's just what the world needs from the rapper at this moment, even if we didn't know it." Mark Elibert of HipHopDX said, "The Grammy Award winner shows he continues to be ambitious as an artist while keeping up the Slaughter King mantra he ran with early in his career. For Young Metro, Savage Mode II asserts there's no rust on his boards and proves he's still one of the best architects in the game."\n\nReviewing the album for Pitchfork, Alphonse Pierre stated "The first Savage Mode didn't become an ATL classic because of celebrity cameos or Billboard numbers; it was because Metro and 21 were at the peak of their powers, and only the producer is close here. 21 Savage is just along for the ride." Steve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews said, "The 44 minutes of this album could exist without Mr. Freeman, but they couldn't exist without Metro Boomin. ...  a solid RAPPER through and through and in an era of singers I'm always going to appreciate that, but if I said I could ignore the banality of Savage Mode II lyrically I'd be lying." In a lukewarm review, Exclaim!'s Jacob Carey wrote, "Whether they hit the mark with their sequel is debatable. While Savage Mode II is by no means a lacklustre album, it may not be the exact product their fans hoped for."\n\nSavage Mode II debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 171,000 album-equivalent units (including 22,000 pure album sales). This became 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one debut. The album also accumulated a total of 200.1 million on-demand streams of the album's songs during that week.\n\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/21+Savage/Savage+Mode+II">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3326 `Ohms (stylized as _Ohms on physical editions) is the ninth studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on September 25, 2020, through Reprise Records. It reached number 5 on the Billboard 200.\n\nMusically, Ohms has been described as an alternative metal and dream pop album. It is the first Deftones album since their eponymous 2003 album to be produced by Terry Date, although the last time the band had worked with him was during the sessions of the unreleased album Eros in 2008. It is also their first album on which Stephen Carpenter utilizes a nine-string guitar.\n\nThe cover art was designed by Frank Maddocks, who had worked with Deftones on each of their albums since White Pony. There are total of 12,995 dots on the cover art. Many fans believed that the design paid tribute to the band's original bassist Chi Cheng, who died in 2013, as the eyes that appear on the cover art lined up closely with a photo of him. Band drummer Abe Cunningham stated in an interview that this was merely a coincidence, however. He added that the cover art idea reminded him of the 1980s, specifically the music video for Prince's 1984 song "When Doves Cry". Shortly before the album's release, Deftones launched the "Adopt a Dot" campaign, allowing for people to purchase one of the dots on the artwork as their own. A photo of the purchaser would then appear as the dot they purchased and be a part of the "Ohms Adopt a Dot digital experience" viewable online. All of the proceeds from the campaign were given to both the UC Davis Children's Hospital and Crew Nation relief fund.\n\nThe band began teasing the album's release with a week-long digital campaign in August 2020. Deftones released cryptic social media posts, their official website and animations through Spotify's Canvas feature that when solved revealed the word "ohms" and longitudinal coordinates for a billboard in Los Angeles teasing the album artwork. The campaign concluded with a formal announcement for Ohms and a music video for the album's first promotional song, "Ohms". The music video for "Ohms" was directed by Rafatoon and featured what Rolling Stone described as, "band performance video interspersed with scenes from a dystopian world, mirroring the musically and lyrically heavy song sentiments." At the time of release, vocalist Chino Moreno described "Ohms" as a "a good scope of where this record's at," though in a separate interview producer Terry Date didn't feel like the song was a good choice for the album's lead promotional track.\n\nDeftones were originally scheduled to tour North America in support of Ohms with Gojira and Poppy in July to September 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed until 2021.\n\nOhms received acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 88, based on 19 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". AllMusic critic Neil Z. Yeung thought that Deftones "take their signature beauty-meets-brutality assault, searching for balance across a tightly focused ten tracks." Yeung further stated: "As a unit, they haven't sounded this refreshed in years." Consequence of Sound's Joseph Schafer described Ohms as "their hardest-hitting effort in years" and "a record that hints at a purified blend of their contrasting influences in its finest moments." Ben Tipple of DIY praised Date’s production work and stated: "If any of Deftones’ previous records are guilty of lacking focus (you decide), ‘Ohms‘ is certainly safe from future vitriol."\n\nDescribing Ohms as "truly and honestly a breath of fresh air," Exclaim! critic Adam Wallis thought that the record was "just as unique and innovative as each album before it." The Independent's Roisin O'Connor regarded the album as "an intriguing addition to the band’s canon," while David McLaughlin Kerrang! likened the it to a "greatest hits  from a parallel plane of existence, yet dense enough to demand deeper exploration." Writing for NME, James McMahon described Ohms as "heavy stuff, both sonically and in emotional clout." Andy Crump of Paste regarded the album as "an engrossing refinement of what they’ve become over years of risk-taking and experimentation." Sputnikmusic staff critic SowingSeason thought that the record "surpasses Deftones’ other iconic releases is in its dense, unpredictable layering and sheer intensity." He further stated: "There aren’t many traits present on Ohms that we’ve never heard from the band before,... but they’ve woven all these glimpses of previous albums together and improved upon them in nearly every facet."\n\nIn a more mixed review, The Guardian's Dean Van Nguyen wrote that the album "lacks the lateral thinking that distinguished the band’s masterpiece, White Pony." Nevertheless, Nguyen further explained: "Still, by streamlining their sound, Deftones have made an album that proves that ferocity is not a diminishing resource."\n\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/Ohms">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3323 'Nectar is the second studio album by Joji, following his successful debut record, BALLADS 1, released in October of 2018.\n\nAfter initially announcing a July 2020 release date, Joji postponed the album to September 25, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThe album boasts a variety of featured singers, rappers, and producers, including: Diplo, Omar Apollo, Lil Yachty, rei brown, BENEE, and Yves Tumor.\n\nThe first single from the record, “Sanctuary,” was released on June 14, 2019.

3321 'On September 22, Fleet Foxes released their fourth studio album Shore at 6:31 am PT/9:31 am ET to coincide exactly with the Autumnal Equinox. The bright and hopeful album, released via Anti-. \n\nShore was recorded before and during quarantine in Hudson (NY), Paris, Los Angeles, Long Island City and New York City from September 2018 until September 2020 with the help of recording and production engineer Beatriz Artola.The fifteen song, fifty-five minute Shore was initially inspired by frontman Robin Pecknold’s musical heroes such as Arthur Russell, Nina Simone, Sam Cooke, Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guebrou and more who, in his experience, celebrated life in the face of death. “I see “shore” as a place of safety on the edge of something uncertain, staring at Whitman’s waves reciting ‘death,’” commented Pecknold. “Tempted by the adventure of the unknown at the same time you are relishing the comfort of the stable ground beneath you. This was the mindset I found, the fuel I found, for making this album.” \n\nPecknold continues: \n\nSince the unexpected success of the first Fleet Foxes album over a decade ago, I have spent more time than I’m happy to admit in a state of constant worry and anxiety. Worried about what I should make, how it will be received, worried about the moves of other artists, my place amongst them, worried about my singing voice and mental health on long tours. I’ve never let myself enjoy this process as much as I could, or as much as I should. I’ve been so lucky in so many ways in my life, so lucky to be born with the seeds of the talents I have cultivated and lucky to have had so many unreal experiences. Maybe with luck can come guilt sometimes. I know I’ve welcomed hardship wherever I could find it, real or imagined, as a way of subconsciously tempering all this unreal luck I’ve had. By February 2020, I was again consumed with worry and anxiety over this album and how I would finish it. But since March, with a pandemic spiraling out of control, living in a failed state, watching and participating in a rash of protests and marches against systemic injustice, most of my anxiety around the album disappeared. It just came to seem so small in comparison to what we were all experiencing together. In its place came a gratitude, a joy at having the time and resources to devote to making sound, and a different perspective on how important or not this music was in the grand scheme of things. Music is both the most inessential and the most essential thing. We don’t need music to live, but I couldn’t imagine life without it. It became a great gift to no longer carry any worry or anxiety around the album, in light of everything that is going on. A tour may not happen for a year, music careers may not be what they once were. So it may be, but music remains essential. This reframing was another stroke of unexpected luck I have been the undeserving recipient of. I was able to take the wheel completely and see the album through much better than I had imagined it, with help from so many incredible collaborators, safe and lucky in a new frame of mind. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fleet+Foxes/Shore">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3278 `Ultimate Success Today is the fifth studio album by American post-punk band Protomartyr. Thematically inspired by lead singer Joe Casey's mid-life crisis in the wake of the band's debut being reissued, the album - conceived as a "valediction" of the band's first decade together - was recorded in 2019 at Dreamland Recording Studios in Hurley, New York with the help of producer David Tolomei. The sessions saw the band playing and recording as a single unit, even to the extent of following similar daily routines. It also notably features collaborations with a number of guest musicians such as Jemeel Moondoc and Fred Lonberg-Holm. The lyrics, mostly written by Casey on the spot, have been described as dark and apocalyptic; while the music has been found to be subtler and more dynamic than the band's past releases.\n\nTitled after "get rich quick" infomercials, the album was scheduled to be released in May, but was postponed to July due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Three singles were released accompanied by their respective videos, and a visual version of the album was made available 2 days before its release. It received "critical acclaim", with many critics finding it reflective of the state of the world at large in 2020 despite being written the year before, while the band also received praise for their stylistic evolution.\n\nThe band's debut album, 2012's No Passion All Technique, was reissued in May 2019. Lead singer Joe Casey later said that that album's re-release, and an "unspecified, pre-Covid sickness" that he was suffering from at the time, had him "thinking about the passage of time and its ultimate conclusion". He elaborated as follows: “Listening to No Passion All Technique again, I could hear myself hoping for an introduction and a long future, but also being cognizant that it could be 'one and done' for us. So, when it came time to write Ultimate Success Today, I was reminded of that first urgency and how it was an inverse of my current grapple with how terribly ill I've been feeling lately. Was that sick feeling colouring how I felt about the state of the world or was it the other way around?” The record was conceived, in his words, as "possible valediction of some confusingly loud five-act play", as well as a "mile marker" of the band's first decade together.\n\nThe album was recorded over 2019 at Dreamland Recording Studios, which is located inside a 19th-century church in Hurley, New York. Produced with the help of David Tolomei (known for his work with Dirty Projectors and Beach House), the album was consciously recorded with a stronger emphasis on collaboration. Casey expanded on the differences between the recording process for this album and the band's past collaborations with Kelley Deal both live and on their Consolation EP: “With Kelley, it was a little more like, “wherever she wants to take it, that's where the song will go.” I think Greg  wanted to continue that as a principle, and he knew he didn't want to use a lot of reverb, effects or keyboards/synths like he usually does. We wanted to bring in collaborators who could replace what Greg did with effects so there can be more space in the songs, but also to collaborate and change the songs as they see fit. The collaborators on this album are people we didn't know ahead of time, and this was our first time doing this kind of thing. We knew Kelley. With your friends, they'll be kinder to you, but you don't want to present strangers and masters of their craft with a shitty song. And finding people to come collaborate was kind of piecemeal.”\n\nThe resulting sessions included contributions from Nandi Rose Plunkett, alto saxophonist Jemeel Moondoc, clarinetist Izaak Mills, and cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm. Plunkett's vocals are prominently featured on "June 21" alongside Casey's, who felt that her contributions would sound refreshing at that point in the album. He also revealed that Mills "is probably on the most songs and was at the studio the longest. He changed "Processed by the Boys" completely by adding that clarinet line, and it was like 'now we're cooking!'" Vocally, Casey himself sought to "tow that line" between sounding more conventional and "more free and ragged and full of personality, which  music inspires.” Mills recalled that Casey wrote much of the lyrics "on the spot" and that he'd spend hours in the booth to record vocal takes for multiple tracks one after another. According to bassist Scott Davidson, the band tried to get in sync for the recordings by "playing and recording as a complete unit", noting that the band had moved in together a few months before the sessions began and even maintained the same sleep schedule and diet.\n\nJemeel Moondoc plays on Ultimate Success Today. Guitarist Greg Ahee described the album as their "nature" record, and was inspired by jazz fusion musician Bennie Maupin's debut The Jewel in the Lotus. Drummer Alex Leonard, on the other hand, was inspired by the work of Wild Beasts drummer Chris T

3257 `"NO" is experimental band Boris's twenty-sixth album, released on July 3, 2020, under label Fangs Anal Satan. No was written and recorded quickly in March 2020 when Boris entered self-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by current international political trends, Boris described the album as "a mirror that gathers and reflects people’s negative energy at a different angle, one that is positive. That is the power and potential of the dark, extreme, and brutal noise music that we have experienced up to this point."\nUnlike the lengthy experimental tracks that dominated the band's last few albums, No consists mostly of short, hardcore-based songs. It includes the cover song "Fundamental Error" by 1990s Japanese hardcore band Gudon.\n\nCredits:\nTakeshi: Vocals, Guitar & Bass\nWata: Vocals, Guitar & Echo\nAtsuo: Vocals, Percussion & Electronics\n\nGuest Guitar: Katsumi on Track 09\nRecording: Fangsanalsatan at Sound Square 2020\nMix & Mastering: Koichi Hara (koichihara-mix.com)\n\n“Fundamental Error" Originally Perfomed by GUDON\n\nLogo Type: Kazumichi Maruoka\nDesign: Fangsanalsatan\nTotal Management: Tomas & Lindsey Zakopal\n\nProduced by Boris\n\nwww.borisheavyrocks.com <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Boris/NO">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3256 `Rough and Rowdy Ways is the 39th studio album by Bob Dylan, released on June 19, 2020, through Columbia Records. It's Dylan's first album of original songs since his 2012 album Tempest, following a trilogy of albums that covered traditional pop standards.\n Rough and Rowdy Ways is his first new material since 2012's Tempest and arrives during a global pandemic and the righteous struggle for racial and economic justice. These ten songs revel in forms that have been Dylan's métier since the '60s: blues, country, folk, rockabilly, gospel, etc. Its three pre-release singles -- "Murder Most Foul," "I Contain Multitudes," and "False Prophet" -- are showcases for a songwriter who speaks directly yet remains elusive.\n\n"I Contain Multitudes" is a meditation on a life yet unfolding; historic figures -- Anne Frank, William Blake, the Rolling Stones, etc. -- jostle against archetypes of gunslingers: "…What can I tell ya? I sleep with life and death in the same bed…." "False Prophet" is a jeremiad disguised as blues house rocker. The protagonist testifies; he's a witness who confronts evil in history and real time. "Goodbye Jimmy Reed" celebrates the bluesman in his own house-rocking style to equate religion, sin, and redemption with romantic obsession and sex. "Crossing the Rubicon" is a roadhouse blues with the afterlife riding shotgun: "Three miles north of purgatory/One step from the great beyond/I pray to the cross/I kiss the girls/and I cross the Rubicon…." Dylan's band are loose and joyful; their raucousness carries his swagger and joy. The suspenseful, loungey "My Own Version of You" features grave robbing as it employs the inspiration of the Bride of Frankenstein to seek truth in taboo. "I've Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You," caressed by marimbas, and brushed snares, finds Dylan blurring distinctions between carnal and spiritual love. Conversely, "Black Rider" whistles past the graveyard, with a nasty caution: "… Don’t hug me, don’t turn on the charm/I'll take a sword and hack off your arm…." In the Celtic gospel of "Mother of Muses," he's a grateful supplicant, a servant who humbly requests transformation knowing full well he may not be entitled: "… wherever you are/I've already outlived my life by far…."\n\nThe album's final half-hour contains only two songs. The nine-plus-minute "Key West (Philosopher Pirate)" is a rambling dirge guided by a soft accordion in a stripped-down journey of longing and weariness; an acknowledgment of mortality with the ghosts of the Beats, Buddy Holly, and Jimi Hendrix alongside him. It stands with his best work from the '70s. That gentle sojourn prepares listeners for "Murder Most Foul," a sprawling, 17-minute lyrical, labyrinthian closer that moves through history, metaphor, and culture with JFK's assassination as its hub. It will be decoded for generations. Rough and Rowdy Ways is akin to transformational albums such as Love and Theft, and Slow Train Coming. It's a portrait of the artist in winter who remains vital and enigmatic. At nearly 80, Dylan's pen and guitar case still hold plenty of magic.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53065380 <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Rough+and+Rowdy+Ways">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3249 `"Mordechai" is the third studio album by American musical trio Khruangbin. It was released June 26, 2020 under Dead Oceans and Night Time Stories.\n\n"Mordechai" has a score of 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on 16 reviews. Dylan Barnabe of Exclaim! reviewed Mordechai is an ode to all that Khruangbin have achieved and a look forward to everything that is to come. Sophia Ordaz of Slant Magazine said "While past Khruangbin albums risked coming off merely as studied tributes to the microcosms of Thai and Iranian rock, "Mordechai" finds Khruangbin coming into their own, thanks to the band’s lyrical development and the honing of their fusion of intercontinental influences."\n\nVinyl LP pressing. 2020 release. "Mordechai" is a story of finding yourself in unexpected places. Travel weary and without a home after 24 itinerant months of travel and touring, Laura Lee went on a hike with a family of strangers, led by a father named "Mordechai". Here, on this least expected journey after so many others, she found spiritual awakening and rebirth. Known already for drawing on the music of locales like Thailand and Iran, Khruangbin found their most diverse and global influence by looking inward, returning to their hometown and America's most diverse city: Houston, TX. With Laura Lee's voice now clear and centered amid a glossolalia of musical influence and 14 languages, Khruangbin have found singularity in multiplicity. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Khruangbin/Mordechai">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3226 `Chromatica is the sixth studio album by American singer Lady Gaga, released on May 29, 2020 by Interscope Records and subsidiary Streamline. Interscope postponed the album's release as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaga supervised the production with longtime collaborator BloodPop, Blackpink, Ariana Grande, Elton John and a variety of producers to create a concept album drawing from her dance-pop roots.\n\nChromatica eschews the acoustic style of Gaga's previous releases, Joanne and A Star Is Born Soundtrack, for a sound gleaning vintage 1990s house music. Gaga resurfaced with a flamboyant cyberpunk-inspired persona to coincide with her experimentation.\n\nThe album's concept explores the pursuit of healing and unwavering happiness. Through often dark introspection of the subject matter, songs on Chromatica manifest Gaga's personal views of themes inspired by failed romance and mental health struggles in her private life. Said sensibility contrasts the music's upbeat thumping instrumentation, distinguished by dense synthesizers, pulsating percussion, ringing grooves and orchestral arrangements which coalesce overarching melodic themes. Most of the recording of the songs was conducted at Henson Recording Studios and Gaga's in-home Hollywood Hills studio. Interscope advertised Chromatica through product endorsements and TV partnerships, part of a more aggressive marketing campaign adversely affected in the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, Interscope released three singles — including the US Billboard Hot 100 top five "Stupid Love" and number one "Rain on Me (with Ariana Grande)" — and two promo tracks to bolster the album's global rollout.\n\nChromatica was well received by the media; among the plaudits were various end-of-2020 list appearances and a Best Pop Vocal Album nomination at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. Critics praised the album for its craftsmanship, though they were sometimes conflicted over the house production in their reviews. Chromatica topped the charts in most overseas markets and, by selling 274,000 album-equivalent units first week, debuted as Gaga's sixth consecutive number one Billboard 200 entry. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/Chromatica">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I do feel quite vulnerable letting people know what’s going on in my private life.

3221 `Notes on a Conditional Form is the fourth studio album by English band The 1975. It was released on 22 May 2020 by Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. Initially titled Music For Cars, the album was intended as the follow-up to I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016). It later came to denote an era spanning two albums. The first, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, released in November 2018. The band recorded much of the second album in London, Los Angeles, Sydney, Northamptonshire and in a mobile studio on their tour bus. The album faced several delays and was submitted only weeks before the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA maximalist experimental album, Notes on a Conditional Form has a free-flowing structure composed of conventional songs, classical orchestral interludes and ambient electronic instrumentals. The album contains loose song structures characterised by their stream of consciousness deliveries, neo-noir ambience, downcast string arrangements, melancholic orchestral flourishes and sudden contrasts. Guest contributions are featured from Phoebe Bridgers, FKA Twigs, Cutty Ranks, climate change activist Greta Thunberg and actor Tim Healy.\n\nNotes on a Conditional Form incorporates numerous genres, combining house, UK garage and various electronic music subgenres with guitar-based acoustic folk, emo, country and multiple rock music subgenres. Thematically, the album focuses on the intricacies of human existence and uses introspection, retrospection, self-reflection and straightforward storytelling. It explores themes of isolation, uncertainty and anxiety, inspired by Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold and Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska. The album's lyrics provide a deconstruction of Healy's extroverted persona, with several reviewers regarding it as the 1975's most personal record.\n\nPrior to the album's debut, the band released The 1975 and the singles People, Frail State of Mind, Me & You Together Song, The Birthday Party, Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America, If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know) and Guys. A North American leg of the band's Music for Cars Tour, planned in support of the album, was cancelled several months prior to the record's debut. An online art exhibition entitled Artists Respond to NOACF, featuring music videos created by various artists, was released in its place. The album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart and reached number one in Australia and Scotland. Elsewhere, it peaked within the top five in Ireland, New Zealand and the United States, and the top 20 in Canada and Japan. The album polarised contemporary music critics; some lauded it as the band's magnum opus, while others derided it as confusing, chaotic and directionless. Despite this, the album appeared on numerous year-end lists and was hailed as the best release of 2020 by The Music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+1975/Notes+on+a+Conditional+Form">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3220 'The title for Gunna’s heavily anticipated WUNNA album—his first full-length project since 2019’s Drip or Drown 2—is an acronym for “Wealthy Unapologetic N\*gga Naturally Authentic”. The Atlanta MC has also claimed that it represents an alternate identity, a chance to step away, if only momentarily, from the franchises that made his name, Drip Season and Drip or Drown. Thankfully for Gunna fans, however, the MC we get in WUNNA isn’t all that different from the man who taught us the meaning of drip.\n\nAcross beats from a veritable wish list of can’t-miss producers including Wheezy, Turbo The Great and Tay Keith, Gunna raps in effortless non sequitur about clothing, jewellery and women. He’s joined by frequent collaborators Lil Baby, Young Thug and Travis Scott, and also Roddy Ricch, who guests on COOLER THAN A BITCH, a song dedicated to anyone mistakenly believing that they’re operating on the same plane as he is. Across 18 tracks, WUNNA is everything fans could have wanted from an MC who’s dedicated his career to establishing himself as a trendsetter.

The album was a "do it yourself" collaborative process with Charli XCX involving her fans in the recording process. The recording and title was inspired by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.

Cook and BJ Burton served as the album's executive producers.\n\nIn November 2019, Charli XCX announced on Twitter that she was planning to record two new albums in 2020, with plans to release both by 2021. On 18 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Charli XCX began a self-isolating livestream series featuring artists such as Diplo, Clairo and Rita Ora.\n\nOn April 3, 2020, a PDF file containing album details was allegedly leaked on Reddit and LanaBoards. It was initially perceived as a prank, but it gained validity when the file was the first hint of the album title, and Charli and Atlantic Records retweeted the image of the file after it was released by FckyeahCharli on Twitter.\n\nOn 6 April 2020, Charli XCX announced through a public Zoom call with fans that she would be working on a new album in self-isolation, with the tentative title how i'm feeling now.

She also said in the stream that A. G. Cook and BJ Burton were among the people she was working with. During the Zoom announcement, Charli XCX set a release date of 15 May 2020.\n\nOn 30 April 2020, Charli XCX announced on Twitter the song titles that were currently considered for the track list and that the yet unreleased fan-favorite "party 4 u" would be on the album as well. The full tracklist and album cover were revealed on 13 May 2020, prior to the album's release.\n\nThis is Charli XCX's "quarantine album." Due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, she recorded the entire project inside her house, with the support of her friends and producers online. Lyrically, Charli referred to this album as her "most optimistic project to date," and she has asked fans to submit her beats and assist her with other projects.

3204 `What Will said on Bandcamp:\n\nNewness and Strangeness\n\nThis album was made from January 2015 to December 2019, starting as a collection of vague ideas that eventually turned into songs. I wanted to make something that was different from my previous records, and I struggled to figure out how to do that. I realized that because the way I listened to music had changed, I had to change the way I wrote music, as well. I was listening less and less to albums and more and more to individual songs, songs from all over the place, every few days finding a new one that seemed to have a special energy. I thought that if I could make an album full of songs that had a special energy, each one unique and different in its vision, then that would be a good thing.\n\nAndrew, Ethan, Seth and I started going into the studio to record songs that had more finished structures and jam on ideas that didn’t. Then I would mess with the recordings until I could see my way to a song. Most of the time on this album was spent shuttling between my house and Andrew’s, who did a lot of the mixing on this. He comes from an EDM school of mixing, so we built up sample-heavy beat-driven songs that could work to both of our strengths.\n\nEach track is the result of an intense battle to bring out its natural colors and transform it into a complete work. The songs contain elements of EDM, hip hop, futurism, doo-wop, soul, and of course rock and roll. But underneath all these things I think these may be folk songs, because they can be played and sung in many different ways, and they’re about things that are important to a lot of people: anger with society, sickness, loneliness, love...the way this album plays out is just our own interpretation of the tracks, with Andrew, Ethan and I forming a sort of choir of contrasting natures.\n\nI think my main hope for the world of music is that it will continue to grow by taking from the past, with a consciousness of what still works now. Exciting moments in music always form at a crossroads - a new genre emerges from the pieces of existing ones, an artist strips down a forgotten structure and makes something alien and novel. If there is a new genre emergent in our times, it has not yet been named and identified, but its threads come from new ways of listening to all types of music, of new methods of creating music at an unprecedented level of affordability and personal freedom, of new audiences rising up through the internet to embrace works that would otherwise be lost, and above all from the people whose love of music drives them to create it in the best form they possibly can. Hopefully it will remain nameless for some time, so it can be experienced with that same newness and strangeness that accompanies any and all meaningful encounters with music.\n\n"Yea but what's with the mask?"\n\nBob Dylan said, “if someone’s wearing a mask, he’s gonna tell you the truth...if he’s not wearing a mask, it’s highly unlikely.” He never actually wore a mask onstage so I don’t know why he said that. But I decided to start wearing a mask for a couple of reasons. One, I still get nervous being onstage with everybody looking at me. If everyone is looking at the mask instead, then it feels like we’re all looking at the same thing, and that is more honest to me. Two, music should be about enjoying yourself, especially live music, and I think of this costume as a way to remind myself and everyone else to have some fun with it. I don’t think it changes anything else about the songs or how you feel about them to be able to drop it for a second and have fun with it. If you can’t do that then you’re in a bad place...\n\nThe character comes from another project Andrew and I have been working on called 1 TRAIT DANGER. This is something Andrew started doing on tour¬—recording ideas for his own songs as they came to him, and forcibly enlisting everyone else to participate. It appealed to me because it was nothing like Car Seat Headrest, and the ideas cracked me up. Before we knew it we had two albums released, a video game that was almost impossible to beat, and a growing number of people who seemed to be enjoying it all. It’s been a great outlet for weird and untenable musical experiments, and the live performances have been a blast. I play a character called TRAIT, and we’ve been working out the backstory as we go. I think he spent a lot of time in classified government facilities before getting into the music business.\n\nThis is the kind of stuff that kept us going while we were working on MADLO. We were in our own little world and free to try any idea we wanted. A lot of the ideas for 1 Trait bled over to the Car Seat tracks, and vice versa. You just can’t make music without first creating your own environment around it...sound’s always gotta travel through something. This time it was a mask.\n\n—trait  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest/Making+a+Door+Less+Open">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3191 `Fetch the Bolt Cutters is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Fiona Apple. It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since The Idler Wheel... in 2012. The album was recorded from 2015 to 2020, largely at Apple's home in Venice Beach. It was produced and performed by Apple alongside Amy Aileen Wood, Sebastian Steinberg and Davíd Garza; recording consisted of long, often-improvised takes with unconventional percussive sounds. GarageBand was used for much of this recording, and Apple credited the album's unedited vocals and long takes to her lack of expertise with the program.\n\nRooted in experimentation, the album largely features unconventional percussion. While conventional instruments, such as pianos and drum sets, do appear, the album also features prominent use of non-musical found objects as percussion. Apple described the result as "percussion orchestras". These industrial-like rhythms are contrasted against traditional melodies, and the upbeat songs often subvert traditional pop structures.\n\nThe album explores freedom from oppression; Apple identified its core message as: "Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you're in". The title, a quote from TV series The Fall, reflects this idea. The album also discusses Apple's complex relationships with other women and other personal experiences, including bullying and sexual assault. It has nevertheless been referred to as Apple's most humorous album.\n\nFetch the Bolt Cutters was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many critics found its exploration of confinement timely. It received significant critical acclaim, and was described as an instant classic and Apple's best work to date. The album received a nomination for Best Alternative Music Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, whilst "Shameika" was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums, with 44,000 equivalent album units. It also charted in the top 15 in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2012, after releasing The Idler Wheel..., Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a concept album based on her home in Venice Beach or the Pando in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members Sebastian Steinberg, Amy Aileen Wood and Davíd Garza. They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's Venice Beach home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.In July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the Sonic Ranch studio in rural Texas, where they recorded most of "Relay", "Ladies", "Cosmonauts" and "On I Go". Apple recalled that these sessions were often unproductive, with the band being distracted by magic mushrooms and films. They returned to Los Angeles, working on the material at Stanley Recordings. Apple decided that recording should relocate to her Venice Beach home studio, where they soon returned. She likened her house to "the womb of where I've developed into an adult", so she chose to record the album at home to "repay" the house. She elaborated on the house's presence in the album: "I really felt like it's an instrument in itself, it's the microphone: The house is the microphone, the house is the ambiance, the house is a member of the band". Further sessions for "Newspaper" and "Heavy Balloon" took place at engineer Dave Way's private studio, Waystation.\n\nThey recorded long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects; her vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound. The sessions at Apple's home were largely recorded with GarageBand. On the long, unedited takes, Apple commented: "I didn't even know how to edit it and make a take shorter, so each track is just this one long take, and if I made a mistake in it, well, I better just play over it and let that mistake work itself into it". This resulted in what Apple described as "percussion orchestras", especially on "Newspaper" and the title track.\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album. At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with Vulture, explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released "a million years ago" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive responses brought Apple back on track. In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being "artwork and stuff". In March, she announced that she had finished recording.\n\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion. The

It was released on April 10, 2020, through Cult and RCA Records. It comes nearly seven years after March 2013’s Comedown Machine, although the band had reunited briefly to release a three-track EP titled "Future Present Past" in June 2016.\n\nThe album title "The New Abnormal" is a reference to the present age of environmental disaster. “There were these huge fires in Los Angeles,” Julian  about their time recording. “A lot of houses burned down but Shangri-La  survived, by some miracle. That’s where the name of the album comes from, the extreme weather, the violence…”\n\nRumors of the album’s production began in July 2017, when Albert Hammond—father of The Strokes’ guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr.—mentioned that the band was in-studio with producer Rick Rubin in an interview with The West Australian. This rumor was quickly dispelled by Hammond Jr. in a since-deleted tweet, claiming: “Forgive Albert Sr he got prematurely excited. A lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time.” He did concede, however, that “We met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe, but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.” Damage control continued with Julian joking on Twitter, saying:\n\n"(What Albert Sr meant to say is we are working with NBA point guard Ricky Rubio on a new offense for our basketball league)"\n\nBack in December 2018, the band announced a series of tour dates and a “global comeback” for 2019. The first event took place at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on May 13, where they performed a new song, titled “The Adults Are Talking.” The last concert of 2019 took place on New Year’s Eve at the Barclays Center in their hometown of Brooklyn, New York. They performed a new song titled “Ode to the Mets.” Julian Casablancas then confirmed:\n\n"Yeah, we’ve got a new album coming out soon. 2020, here we come. The 2010s, whatever the fuck they’re called, we took ‘em off. And now we’ve been unfrozen and we’re back. If you really love someone, you’ll be frozen with them. You know what? I don’t know what I say generally, and I ramble a lot, but I lo"ve you guys, and it’s a real honor to share the stage and this night with you guys.\n\n- via Rolling Stone (January 2020)\n\nNews around the album’s actual release began on February 7, 2020, when Albert Hammond Jr. tweeted: “You think you’ve been waiting. But the wait has just begun. Welcome to the new abnormal.” Similar videos and promotions began appearing on the band members’ social media pages and billboards around the world. Leaked ASCAP listings for “songs written by Julian Casablancas” also revealed the tracklist and various co-writers on the album, including pop-rock icon Billy Idol.\n\nA few days later on February 10, 2020, the band played a live political rally in support of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A short musical snippet of “At the Door” played before the concert, foretelling of the song’s official release the next day, along with the music video and the upcoming album’s tracklist and album art. The band also performed a new song titled “Bad Decisions,” which was released the following Tuesday, February 18, 2020, along with its accompanying music video. According to Albert Hammond Jr.’s Twitter, this would be the first official single for the new record.\n\nOn April 6, 2020, the band released “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus” as the final single preceding the album’s release.\n\nThe New Abnormal debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200 during the chart week of April 26, 2020 after selling approximately 35,000 album-equivalent units during its first week.\n\nOn March 14, 2021, The Strokes won their first-ever Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of the Year at the 63rd Grammy Awards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/The+New+Abnormal">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 3172 'Aporia is a New Age album from Sufjan Stevens and his step-father and record label co-owner, Lowell Brams. The 21 songs on Aporia are tightly crafted, resonating with a gem-like intensity, made in the spirit of the New Age composers who sanded off the edges of their synths’ sawtooth waves. Aporia approximates a rich soundtrack from an imagined sci-fi epic brimming with moody, hooky, gauzy synthesizer soundscapes, suggesting the progeny of a John Carpenter, Wendy Carlos, and Mike Oldfield marriage -- but it stands apart from these touchstones and generates a meditative universe all its own. \n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sufjan+Stevens/Aporia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Wylde states "One message is loud and clear in West Of Eden. ANGER. BILE. FIRE. MURDER. Because what is art without bile? Millennial humour is furious and surreal, driven by anti-depressants and anxiety. What we’ve got now is a world full of millennials that have grown up to make art about these injustices. HMLTD have done just that, focusing their trials and tribulations through a magnifying glass to burn us mere ants. And oh, how I love a bit of self-immolation."\n\nLizzie Manno, writing for Paste Magazine, gave West of Eden an 8 out of 10, describing the album as "an ambitious depiction of humanity's downfall".

3127 'Funeral is Lil Wayne’s thirteenth studio album and the follow-up to September 2018’s Tha Carter V. The 24-track album boasts appearances from a plethora of artists, including Jay Rock, Takeoff, Adam Levine, Big Sean, and XXXTENTACION.\n\nWayne first teased Funeral during a November 2016 interview with The Nine Club:\n\nThe album was mentioned sparingly until April 30, 2019, when Wayne posted a single coffin emoji on his Instagram story, a vague allusion to Funeral’s impending release.\n\nWayne then began promoting the album in several interviews, such as his July interview with XXL and his August interview with Q93, the hip-hop radio station in New Orleans.\n\nWayne initiated the album’s rollout on January 22, posting a video graphic of the album’s artwork to social media. The following day, he confirmed the album’s release date, and in the subsequent days, he posted snippets of several songs.\n\nWhen 12 AM EST arrived on January 31, Wayne dismayed fans by delaying the album until 3 AM EST. However, the album briefly (and accidentally) appeared on YouTube Music at midnight.\n\nFuneral is a particularly dark album and seems to allude to a reimagining of Wayne’s public persona. He discusses themes of hatred, guilt, and death, and the LP can be viewed as a symbolic “funeral” of his previously joyful character. It may also allude to him finally terminating his business relationship with Cash Money Records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Wayne/Funeral">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3121 `Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial (on-cover styling Please excuse me for being antisocial) is the debut studio album by American rapper Roddy Ricch, released by Atlantic Records and Bird Vision Entertainment on December 6, 2019. It features guest appearances from Gunna, Lil Durk, Meek Mill, Mustard, Ty Dolla Sign, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and spent four non-consecutive weeks atop. It features the singles, "Big Stepper", "Start wit Me" featuring Gunna, "Tip Toe" featuring A Boogie wit da Hoodie, and "High Fashion". Prior to being released as a single, "The Box" became Roddy Ricch's highest-charting song of his career, reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; the song later became the album's fourth single.\n\nIn an interview with Revolt, the album's audio engineer Chris Dennis uncovered some of the album's recording sessions. Dennis recalls first meeting Roddy Ricch at a studio session one a day in March 2019, whereafter they "just kept working ever since then" from that day on. Ricch had just returned to the US after touring with Post Malone on the European leg of Malone's Beerbongs & Bentleys Tour. Ricch's label wanted to start working on his debut album, something which Ricch also expressed interest in. Dennis says they spent a "solid year" working on the album, changing tracklists constantly and recording new music. He used production software Plugin Alliance which, he explained, "has no latency in the recording on any of the plugins". For the album, Ricch didn't want to employ a lot of effects or reverb, because "he likes his stuff really clean, dry, and in your face. That was the learning curve in the beginning — getting his clean vocals. You also have to work fast because he can record a song in 10 minutes", Dennis stated. "The Box", for instance, was recorded in roughly 15 minutes. On the track "War Baby", a choir was used, an idea Ricch came up with. The choir was arranged through Ricch's cousin.\n\nAround 250 songs were recorded for the album. Dennis stated that a lot of those songs will instead appear on other artists' albums.\n\nPlease Excuse Me for Being Antisocial debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 101,000 album-equivalent units (including 3,000 pure album sales) in its first week. It is Roddy Ricch's first number one on the chart. In its second week, the album fell to number three on the chart with 81,000 units. In its third week, the album remained at number three on the chart earning 73,000 more units that week. In its fourth week, the album climbed to number two on the chart with 74,000 units. In its fifth week, it regained the number one position on the chart, earning 97,000 album-equivalent units, an increase of 31% in total units over the previous week. The album topped the charts for a third time with 95,000 units sold in its 8th week of release. The album later returned to number one on the chart for a fourth time with 79,000 units sold in its 10th week on the chart. It became the longest running number one debut rap album in the US since 2003. On April 10, 2020, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over one million units in the United States.\n\nFive songs off the album also managed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, with "The Box" being the highest charting song, spending eleven weeks at number one on the chart despite no initial single release. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Ricch/Please+Excuse+Me+for+Being+Antisocial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Brion, who worked with Miller on the album, completed production "based on his time and conversations" with Miller. "Swimming" and "Circles" were planned to be the first two instalments in a trilogy of albums, where the last piece would have been "a pure hip-hop record", as described by Brion.\n\nCircles was announced by Miller's family via a note on his Instagram account on January 8, 2020.

3113 `Music to Be Murdered By is the eleventh studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on January 17, 2020, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. It was released with no prior announcement, in a similar fashion to his previous studio album Kamikaze (2018). The album was produced by Eminem and Dr. Dre, amongst other producers. It features guest appearances from Skylar Grey, Young M.A, Royce da 5'9", White Gold, Ed Sheeran, the late Juice Wrld, Black Thought, Q-Tip, Denaun, Anderson .Paak, Don Toliver, Kxng Crooked, and Joell Ortiz.\n\nThe album's title, cover art, and concept are inspired by Alfred Hitchcock and Jeff Alexander's 1958 spoken word album Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By. The album was supported by two singles: "Darkness" and "Godzilla". Alongside the album's surprise release, Eminem also released the music video for "Darkness", which revolves around the 2017 Las Vegas shooting from the point of view of the perpetrator Stephen Paddock alternating with Eminem's own.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 279,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. Subsequently, Eminem became the first artist to have ten consecutive number-one albums in the US and one of six artists to have released at least ten US number-one albums. Music critics praised Eminem's lyrical abilities and the improved production after Kamikaze, while criticism was directed towards the album's formulaic song structure, lack of innovation, and shock value.\n\nThe Mayor of Manchester, England, Andy Burnham, responded to Eminem making light of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, saying, "This is unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful to the families and all those affected." The criticism of the album's subject matter led to Eminem responding in an open letter, saying that Music to Be Murdered By is "not for the squeamish" and is "designed to shock the conscience.\n\nOn December 18, 2020, Eminem released a deluxe version of the album, named Music to Be Murdered By: Side B, without any prior announcement. It includes the original album's 20 tracks along with 16 new ones. It includes a variety of features, with guest appearances from Skylar Grey, DJ Premier, Ty Dolla $ign, Dr. Dre, Sly Pyper, MAJ, and White Gold.\n\nIn 2019, A&R representative Mike "Heron" Herard of Shady Records pursued production contributions for a new album by Eminem. This was a departure from his usual process at his company BeatleHustle, which manages sample composers who send their beats to high-profile producers. Eventually, a group of producers had been enlisted for the project, including Eminem's longtime creative partners Royce da 5'9" and Dr. Dre, as well as the latter's colleagues – Dawaun Parker, Lawrence Jr., Dem Jointz, and Erik Griggs – and young, burgeoning producers – D.A. Doman (producer of Tyga's "Taste") and Ricky Racks (producer of Future's "Crushed Up").\n\nAccording to a January 2020 Rolling Stone feature on the album's making, "Lawrence Jr. has been working sporadically with Dr. Dre since the rapper-producer left Death Row Records in the Nineties; starting in the summer, the drummer went into the studio with the rest of Dr. Dre's team to create a suite of tracks that ended up on the back half of Music to Be Murdered By." Lawrence Jr. told the magazine, "Dem Jointz is a producer, Eric Griggs plays keys, bass, and guitar, Dawaun Parker is a keyboard player and producer, myself, I'm a drummer. We know Dre’s instincts, and he’s the coach, the orchestrator.\n\nOther collaborators for the album included Black Thought, Q-Tip, Juice Wrld, Ed Sheeran, Young M.A, Skylar Grey, Don Toliver, Anderson .Paak, Kxng Crooked and Joell Ortiz. On the track "Godzilla", Eminem recorded a third verse that broke the record for the fastest verse on a charted track, rapping 10.65 syllables per second. Eminem surpassed his own records held by his featured verse on Nicki Minaj's 2018 song "Majesty", where he rapped 10.3 syllables per second, and his 2013 single "Rap God", where he rapped 9.6 syllables per second.\n\nThe album's title and alternative cover art share the same concept as the 1958 album Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By, which interspersed audio of the director Alfred Hitchcock's wry, dark humor into easy listening instrumentals arranged by Jeff Alexander. Eminem tweeted an image of the 1958 album cover featuring Hitchcock holding an axe and a gun to his head and stated that his album's alternative cover was "inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!". Audio of Hitchcock's voice from the 1958 album is sampled in the interludes "Alfred" and "Alfred (Outro)" and the beginning of the track "Little Engine". Both the 1958 and 2020 albums end with Hitchcock stating, "If you haven’t been murdered, I can only say better luck next time. If you have been, goodnight, wherever you are.

3104 `"Jane Doe" is the fourth full-length studio album by American metalcore band Converge. The album is often considered Converge's masterpiece, and has been frequently described as one of the greatest metal/hardcore albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone, Decibel, and NPR Music. According to vocalist/lyricist Jacob Bannon, "the album's lyrical themes were born out of a dissolving relationship and the emotional fallout from that experience"\n\nIn January 2007, Decibel magazine certified the album number 35 in the "Decibel Hall of Fame", and later named it the best album of the '00s. J. Bennett writes that "Jane Doe was both a semi-melodic milestone ("Hell to Pay", "Thaw", the title track) and a discordant landmark (everything else), far and away the most crucial metallic hardcore record since Cave In unleashed Until Your Heart Stops three years earlier", while Kerrang! stated "With feral blasting, extreme technicality, intense emotion and an overwhelmingly bleak tone...  awe-inspiring listening experience..." On June 11, 2010, Sputnikmusic deemed Jane Doe the best album of the decade, earning the #1 spot on its top 100 albums of the decade list. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Converge/Jane+Doe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3105 `The Black Parade is the third studio album by My Chemical Romance. Released on October 24, 2006 through Reprise Records, it was produced by Rob Cavallo, known for having produced multiple albums for Goo Goo Dolls and Green Day. It is a rock opera centering on a dying character with cancer known as "The Patient". The album tells the story of his apparent death, experiences in the afterlife, and subsequent reflection on his life.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: "Welcome to the Black Parade", "Famous Last Words", "I Don't Love You", and "Teenagers". The Black Parade has received generally favorable reviews, and the band achieved its first Number 1 single in the UK with "Welcome to the Black Parade". The album debuted at number two on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart and is also certified as platinum by the RIAA, as well as a Platinum certification in the UK and a Gold certificacion in Argentina by the CAPIF and in Chile by the IFPI Chile. The Black Parade was given the Platinum Europe Award by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for 1 million sales in Europe. The limited edition boxed set also earned My Chemical Romance a Grammy Award nomination. In the video game Guitar Hero II (Xbox 360 version), the song "Dead!" was added to the game's track list prior to the earlier PS2 version, and the three songs "Teenagers," "Famous Last Words" and "This Is How I Disappear" are available for download. The Black Parade has sold 1,610,000 copies in the US as of October 2010, and has sold 3,000,000 copies worldwide. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Chemical+Romance/The+Black+Parade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3103 `Laughing Stock is the fifth and final LP from Talk Talk, released on November 19, 1991 from Polydor records. It marks the pinnacle of the band's transformation from synth-pop into an experimental, impressionistic sound that would later share characteristics with what music critics called post-rock; as such, it is the quintessential document of a proto-post-rock sound from this incredibly creative group, and it serves as a touchstone record for the era. Since it's release, many years later it has been hailed as a lost classic of the grunge-era nineties.\n\nTalk Talk had been steadily gestating a sound transformation from records in the late eighties before Laughing Stock, but those records lacked a cohesive, full production level to make their output from that era stand out as much as it could have. Since Laughing Stock has a much higher production value level, it is distinguishable from the earlier records, and generally serves as a reference to this band's greatest work. Much has been said of this record's seemingly singular identity; it tends to present itself as if it has its own world of sound. Elements of jazz, contemporary-classical, alternative rock and post-punk collude throughout the album to form a distinctly unique listening experience from start to finish. Despite all those present elements, this record defies easy categorization. It would influence later jazz-inflecting rock combos like Tortoise and Sea and Cake as they crafted similarly engrossing albums. \n\nIt is critically regarded as a top-notch record. Many publications have retroactively named it one of the best records of the nineties, albeit it was mostly ignored upon its initial release and for a while after that. Perhaps the pressure of the public's general ambivalence mixed with the demands of making such a creative work caused Talk Talk to disband, but they are nevertheless remembered now as essential listening, with Laughing Stock exalted above their other records. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Talk+Talk/Laughing+Stock">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3094 `"Fine Line" is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Harry Styles, released on 13 December 2019 by Columbia and Erskine Records. The album's themes involve the initial excitement of meeting someone, breakups, and "having sex and feeling sad", as Styles has said himself. The record has been described as pop rock, with elements of prog-pop, psychedelic pop, folk, soul, funk and indie pop.\n\nSupported by five singles—"Lights Up", "Adore You", "Falling", "Watermelon Sugar" and "Golden"—"Fine Line" debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the Billboard 200, making it Styles' second consecutive number-one album in the US. The album had the third-largest sales week of 2019 in the US and broke the record as the biggest debut from a British male artist since Nielsen SoundScan began, earning 478,000 album-equivalent units. It has been certified platinum in the US for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over one million units in the country.\n\n"Fine Line" received generally positive reviews from music critics, particularly towards its production and stylistic influences. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2020 Brit Awards, and is nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2021 Grammy Awards. The album has also received Grammy Award nominations for "Watermelon Sugar" in the Best Pop Solo Performance category and "Adore You" in the Best Music Video category.

3102 `The Velvet Rope is the sixth studio album by Janet Jackson, released on October 7, 1997, through Virgin Records. Prior to its release, she renegotiated her contract with Virgin for US$80 million, the largest recording contract in history at that time.\n\nUpon experiencing an emotional breakdown, Jackson began facing a long-term case of depression. She in turn developed her new record as a concept album, using introspection as its theme. Its title is a metaphor for emotional boundaries, as well as an allusion to an individual's need to feel special. Its lyrics address subject matter such as depression, self-worth, social networking, and domestic violence. It also encompasses themes of sexuality, including BDSM, sexual orientation and same-sex relationships. Due to its sexually explicit content, the album reinforced Jackson's public image as a sex symbol and as one of the most erotic vocalists of the 1990s. Its incorporation of social issues regarding sexual orientation and combating homophobia also established her reputation as a gay icon and received the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Janet+Jackson/The+Velvet+Rope">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3088 `In 2017, Wu-Tang Clan's Raekwon took the mic during a Griselda Records showcase at New York’s Webster Hall, and hailed the Buffalo rap crew for “carrying the torch”. That historical moment marked an early hip-hop coronation for the Buffalo, New York, label/collective, who have since signed to Eminem's Shady Records. Following wave after wave of gritty independently released street-savvy mixtapes and coveted merch drops from BENNY THE BUTCHER and brothers Conway the Machine and Westside Gunn, the crew's core trio deliver on their promise with their Shady Records debut.\n\n\nLest there be any concern that Shady’s major-label shine would somehow diminish Griselda's presence or dull their menace, WWCD revels in some of the darkest corners of the crew’s classic East Coast rap aesthetic, as evidenced by the murky atmospheres and ice-cold rhythms of “Chef Dreds” and “Moselle”. On the virtual cipher “Scotties”, they trade off relentlessly every few bars, with Benny launching memorable lines like "I remember listening to the Wu in ’95/Got my first strap from Conway in ’99." Narrative moments like the bloody “Freddie HotSpot” tether Griselda to the lyrical crime-spree glories of the 1990s rap canon, while a guest verse by 50 Cent on “City on the Map” and an essential, full-circle intro from Raekwon himself only further establish their bona fides. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Griselda/WWCD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3090 `Death Atlas is the eighth studio album by American deathgrind band Cattle Decapitation. Released on 29 November, 2019 via Metal Blade Records. Its release coincides with Black Friday and comes more than four years after their previous studio album, 2015's The Anthropocene Extinction. It is the band's first album to feature second guitarist Belisario Dimuzio and new bassist Olivier Pinard. At just under 55 minutes, it is also their longest album to date.\nDeath Atlas was recorded at Denver's Flatline Audio with producer Dave Otero. Album artwork is by Wes Benscoter. Vocalist Travis Ryan comments: "We have crafted what we feel is our strongest album to date", (...) "Musically and lyrically, there is a lot of grief, anger, hate, passion, and emotion poured into this one". Prior to the album release, the band co-headlined the 2019 Summer Slaughter Tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Cattle+Decapitation/Death+Atlas">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3086 `Reflections is the debut studio album by British singer and visual artist Hannah Diamond. It was released on 22 November 2019 via PC Music.\n\nReflections initially was intended to be released as an EP in late 2016 with its lead single being "Fade Away", which was released on 7 October 2016. Following the announcement of the EP, Diamond released "Make Believe" on 23 December 2016. She continued to hint at new music throughout 2017 and 2018, telling fans via social media that new music would be imminent.\n\nA mix titled Soon I Won't See You at All was released on 13 December 2017, produced entirely by A.G. Cook and featured three songs which would also be featured on Reflections. The three tracks were "Never Again", "Concrete Angel" (a cover of a song by Gareth Emery) and "The Ending".\n\n"True" was released as the official lead single from the album on 16 November 2018. It was released alongside a lyric video featuring a typeface Diamond made herself. The track received attention for its more emotional sound; regarded by Matt Moen of Paper Magazine as "weaving sentimentality and emotion through a landscape of digital disconnect and jaded apathy". In press releases, it was stated that Reflections would be released in early 2019, however this did not come to fruition.\n\n"Invisible" was released as the album's second single on 30 October 2019, alongside a music video directed by Daniel Swan & Hannah Diamond. On the same day, it was announced that Reflections would be released on 22 November 2019, and the cover art for the album was also revealed. On the following day, her first headlining tour "The Invisible Tour" was announced in support of the album. It began on 4 December 2019.\n\n"Love Goes On" was released as the album's third single on 13 November 2019, alongside a music video directed by Vasilisa Forbes.\n\nThe tracklist of Reflections was revealed via Diamond's social media on 21 November 2019.\n\nVinyl versions of the album were announced in November 2019 for later release, and was later announced in January 2020 that they were up for pre-order and would be released in sometime in 2020. On 22 April 2020, Diamond released an EP of remixes of songs from the album.\n\nReflections is a pop, trance, and bubblegum pop record, with elements of breakcore, happy hardcore, Eurodance, synthwave, electro house, and techno. The album explores themes of heartbreak and human emotions, in contrast to the robotic aesthetic crafted by Diamond early on in her career. It was described by one critic as a "breakup album". The album's sound has been compared to the works of Charli XCX, Sarah Bonito, Caroline Polachek, Imogen Heap, and Porter Robinson. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hannah+Diamond/Reflections">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3078 `"Sea of Worry" is the third studio album by American band Have a Nice Life, released on November 8, 2019, on the Flenser. It is their first album to feature a full band.\n\nThe album was announced by the band in August 2019. Shortly after the announcement, on the 27th, the band released the title track as a single. Three other singles were released in advance of the album: "Lords of Tresserhorn", on September 17th; "Science Beat", on October 15th; and "Dracula Bells", on November 7th.\n\nTwo of the tracks, "Trespassers W" and "Destinos", were re-recorded versions of songs that appeared on their 2009 compilation album Voids. Dan Barrett had been working on producing "Destinos" by 2006 at the latest, according to a blog post.\n\nThe album has been described as more straightforward and accessible than the band's previous two LPs. Similarly, it is significantly more polished and has higher production quality, a departure from the band's typical lo-fi sound.\n\nThe album takes influence from several genres, varying from track to track. Songs like "Sea of Worry", "Science Beat", and "Dracula Bells" have been compared to post-punk, new wave, and gothic rock. "Lords of Tresserhorn", according to Marika Zorzi of New Noise Magazine, "seamlessly blends their sweeping shoegaze/post-punk/experimental sound" in a way reminiscent of their earlier releases, while Bill Peel of "Kill Your Stereo" noted a post-rock influence. The album also features an instrumental track: "Everything We Forget".\n\nMuch like the band's previous releases, many songs feature lyrics about depression. Moreover, several songs discuss religion, particularly Christianity. "Dracula Bells" and "Trespassers W" both feature lyrics critical of the religion, while "Destinos" begins with a recording of a preacher lecturing about God sending sinners to hell.\n\nThe name of the track "Lords of Tresserhorn" is a reference to Magic: the Gathering. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Have+a+Nice+Life/Sea+of+Worry">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3081 'A Love Letter To You 4 is the fourth entry in Trippie Redd’s mid series of ALLTY mixtapes.

3074 'H.A.Q.Q. is the fourth studio album by transcendental black metal band Liturgy. Featuring their characteristic yearning guitar harmonies, epic song structures, and intense drumming, H.A.Q.Q. boils over with harp, piano, gagaku ensemble, pitched percussion, strings, and digital manipulation. It represents a consolidation of the band’s sound to date, a combination of the mathematical complexity of 2011’s Aesthethica and the glitchy experimental fervor of 2015’s The Ark Work. While ecstatically invoking heaven, H.A.Q.Q. is also Liturgy’s most vulnerable record for Hunter Hunt-Hendrix, addressing anger and struggles around mental health, sexuality, and religion. In part a reflection on Liturgy’s uniquely controversial career, it attempts to render the spirit of a cultural era whose basic fabric is unravelling, and to generate an energy of prophecy and love in the name of what is to come.\n\nHunt-Hendrix composed the album during 2018, drawing from a reservoir of material, some of which had existed for years, while simultaneously creating the forthcoming opera Origin of the Alimonies and philosophical System of Transcendental Qabala (depicted graphically on H.A.Q.Q.’s album cover). These latter two projects represent an interdisciplinary effort to create a total meaning system. The composition of H.A.Q.Q. was a sudden detour, but it is related to these other works as a point of entry. After performing in the debut of Origin of the Alimonies in the fall of 2018, the band spent 6 months bringing the album to life before recording it in August of 2019 at Machines with Magnets with Seth Manchester.\n\nH.A.Q.Q. stands for Haelegen above Quality and Quantity, and represents Hunt-Hendrix’s uniquely marxist and psychoanalytic vision of God.\n\nHunter Hunt-Hendrix - guitar, vocals\nBernard Gann - guitar\nTia Vincent-Clark - bass\nLeo Didkovsky - drums\n\nEric Wubbels - piano on track 2\nCharlotte Mundy - voice on tracks 1 and 3\nCory Bracken - vibraphone on tracks 4 and 6\nLeo Didkovsky - glockenspiel on tracks 4 and 6\nHunter Hunt-Hendrix - piano on tracks 5, 7, 9\nMarilu Donovan - harp on tracks 1, 3, 6, 8\nTadlow Ensemble - strings on tracks 4 and 6\nLucie Vitovka - hichiriki on track 1\nAdam Robinson - ryuteki on track 1\n\nRecorded in August 2019 and mixed by Seth Manchester at Machines with Magnets.

The album features guest appearances from Smino, Tyga and Gucci Mane.\n\nIn an interview, Doja described her album in the following words: "I named the album 'Hot Pink' because I wanted people to feel that before they got into the music that it felt passionate, warm and welcoming," she said in a statement.

3068 `"KIWANUKA" is the Mercury Prize winning third studio album from singer and songwriter Michael Kiwanuka. He is beloved by progressive music fans in his native U.K. He's been nominated for the Mercury Prize for his previous albums ("Home Again" and "Love & Hate") and also received a Brit Prize nom for the latter. Further, his song "Cold Little Heart" became a kind of international indie hit after it was chosen as the theme song for HBO's star-studded series Big Little Lies. Born to Ugandan parents who fled during Idi Amin's reign of terror and settled in Muswell Hill, Kiwanuka has had to fight to keep his identity at the forefront of the culture; numerous record execs tried to get him to dump his birth name for one easier to market, resulting in such a crisis of self-confidence that he shelved an earlier album called Night Songs, recorded as the initial follow-up to "Home Again", so he could decide if he even wanted to continue pursuing a musical vocation. This third album wears its self-titling as a badge of honor, a statement of who Michael Kiwanuka as artist and individual is. Once more produced by Danger Mouse and Inflo, this 13-song set is a brave, colorful collection that provides an exceptionally well-rounded aural portrait of Kiwanuka's massive and diverse talent. If one had to choose a genre umbrella for this release, the term "21st century psychedelic soul" would fit better than anything else. The opening tune here, "You Ain't the Problem," carries the inspiration of Curtis Mayfield in its rave-up chorus, while "Rolling" melds sweeping soul and the reverbed guitar psychedelia of Arthur Lee and Love. "Hero," at least initially, is a haunted, acoustically driven folk ballad: "I won't change my name/No matter what they call me." It transforms from a first-person manifesto into a trippy yet direct folk-rock homage to Fred Hampton, late president of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party, who was gunned down by city police as he slept. "This Kind of Love" is perhaps the first tune to ever meld Bill Withers' folksy, funky soul to Terry Callier's singular, jazzed-up take on the genre. "Hard to Say Goodbye" is a weave of exotica-tinged, pillowy strings; Pink Floyd-esque guitar and effects atmospherics; and the sophisticated soul of Stevie Wonder circa Talking Book. Lyrically, the album reveals Kiwanuka at his most vulnerable and strident (no mean feat). The dramatic nature of his songwriting is gifted to listeners in catchy earworms, adventurous textural interludes, provocative lyrics, and through an ambitious melodic palette. As fine as Love & Hate was -- worthy of all its accolades -- Kiwanuka stands head and shoulders above it as a complex, communicative, poetic, and sometimes even profound collection that wears its heart on its sleeve and its sophistication in its grooves. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Kiwanuka/KIWANUKA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3057 `"Pony" is the third studio album and major-label debut by English musician Rex Orange County. It was released on 25 October 2019.\n\nHannah Mylrea from NME wrote of the album: "A dazzling follow up to "Apricot Princess", Rex Orange County’s third studio album is a total delight. It may be miserable outside, and the world's going to shit, but try listening to "Pony" and not feeling a little bit more optimistic about the future. Go on, we dare you." Elly Watson expressed similar views in DIY magazine, describing it as "equal parts heart wrenching and hopeful".\n\nGiving the album an average 3 out of 5, Tara Joshi at The Guardian described the album as "jaunty and engaging", though Joshi expressed that ""Pony" meanders, seemingly unaware of its purpose".\n\nLuke Levenson from American Songwriter commented: "His unique pop prosody and production skills, more sophisticated than ever in Pony, foretell that his sound will continue progressing to new creative heights, with the heft of catchy pop music and the inventiveness of its growing indie subgenre." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rex+Orange+County/Pony">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3054 'JESUS IS KING is Kanye West’s ninth studio album and the follow-up to his June 2018 release, ye. The project debuted on October 25, 2019, a little over a year after the initial release date for Yandhi, which was scrapped and reworked into a gospel album.\n\nTo the surprise of many, his wife Kim Kardashian took to Twitter on August 29, 2019, to announce Ye’s newest solo effort on his behalf—along with its title, tracklist, and release date. On the same day, producer Teddy Walton tweeted about his involvement with the project:\n\n"Been editing these @kanyewest vocals to make it sound like some graduation shit. The year ain’t done."\n\nThroughout 2019, Kanye began hosting “Sunday Service” worship events, where he performs gospel-inspired versions of his classic songs with a choir and special guests. On the morning of Easter 2019, he debuted the album’s seventh track, “Water,” at Coachella’s Sunday Service.\n\nOn September 27, 2019, fans speculated that Kanye would release the album after his Detroit Sunday Service. Instead, Detroit’s Fox Theatre announced a free show via Twitter, called ‘Jesus Is King: A Kanye West Experience,’ where Kanye played the album privately. An hour before the show’s start, Kim tweeted once again, sharing an updated tracklist. After the show, Kim uploaded an Instagram story announcing that the album would release on Sunday, September 29, following listening parties in Chicago and New York. This release date, however, went unmet and there were no subsequent announcements for almost a month.\n\nOn October 20, 2019, Kanye made a sudden reappearance on Twitter to announce that the new release date was set for October 25, 2019. He also revealed the cover art, featuring blue vinyl.\n\nFollowing its release, the album opened at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, as well as the Gospel, Christian and R&B/Hip-Hop albums charts. It was the first time that a Christian-centered, hip-hop album would top the main national chart since 2014, when Lecrae had managed to do the same with his album Anomaly.\n\nIt was also Kanye’s ninth consecutive debut at number one in his career, tying him with a record held by Eminem: a fair share that lasted until 2020, when the Detroit-based rapper took the lead again, following the chart-topping debut of Music to be Murdered By. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/JESUS+IS+KING">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3052 `"There Existed an Addiction to Blood" is the third studio album by American hip-hop group clipping. It was released on October 18, 2019 through Sub Pop. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics.\n\nClipping described "There Existed an Addiction to Blood" in a press release as a "transmutation of horrorcore," continuing that it "absorbs the hyper-violent horror tropes of the Murder Dog era, but re-imagines them in a new light: still darkly-tinted and somber, but in a weirder and more vivid hue." Throughout the album, Daveed Diggs describes "gruesome movie scenarios," but, according to the Financial Times journalist Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, the lyrics do not contain the "sick " and misogyny associated with the genre. Diggs speaks in the second person in the tracks, which Tom Breihan of Stereogum interpreted to be in order to do "everything he can to put us, the listeners, in the shoes of the victims."\n\nThe album title comes from the Sam Waymon song "The Blood of Thing (Part 2) Shadow of the Cross", written for the vampire film Ganja & Hess. This song is also sampled in "Blood of the Fang".\n\n"There Existed an Addiction to Blood" received mostly positive reviews: aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalized rating of 73, based on 11 critical reviews. Paul Simpson of AllMusic described the album's "most exciting tracks" as "downright hallucinatory" and considered that Diggs' delivery is "precise and unflinching, detailing gruesome scenes with pinpoint accuracy." The Line of Best Fit's Jack Bray hailed as "disheartening and sonically intriguing," adding that it "is yet another successful experiment for the group and one of the eeriest examples of modern hip-hop to date." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/clipping./There+Existed+An+Addiction+To+Blood">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3039 'On "Terror Management", billy woods weaves past, present and future into a dark tableau as hilarious as it is macabre. This is a place where skeletons spill from closets, lead pours from faucets and the punchline is the whole joke. This is the sound of the police not coming, of garbage trucks in reverse, of glaciers shearing off into a black ocean. But these are also tales of perseverance, compassion and love, however quixotic. Of snatching one’s humanity from the fires that rage all about us.\n\n"Terror Management" features production from Preservation, Blockhead, Willie Green, Messiah Muzik, Small Pro, ELUCID, Child Actor, Steel Tipped Dove, Uncommon Nasa, Jeff Markey and Shape.

3035 `"Come In" is Weatherday's debut album, released in 2019 and welcomed by the indie rock community. Sputnik, the creative genius behind Weatherday, cites emo and classical music (from the Classical and Romantic era) as inspiration. Several fans assume Car Seat Headrest's "Twin Fantasy" as an obvious source of inspiration, but Sputnik denies that "Twin Fantasy" had conscious influence over "Come In." However, what should be mentioned is that the character on the album cover, Mio, derives from Sputnik's now-abolished webcomic that explores foreign identity. Sputnik's webcomic is also a huge inspiration to "Come In."\n\nIn the article, "Sonemic Interview: Weatherday/Lola's Pocket PC," Sputnik explains the gender and sexuality themes embedded in "Come In." They say, "Everything ties into letting someone or something into your personal space or consciousness, even having a second person perspective where you're 'on the other side of the door' at times." LGBTQ is an important theme that Sputnik hopes listeners will take note of. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weatherday/Come+In">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3025 'Chelsea stated in the interview with Metal Hammer :\n"It’s definitely misunderstood and something that I have been into for a long time (witchcraft), but I’ve been talking about witchcraft more openly recently. Birth Of Violence is tied to that awakening in myself and I wanted to share that with anyone else who might be feeling that kind of nudge inside themselves as well. There’s something in witchcraft that we call ‘shadow work’, which is basically confronting the darker parts of yourself, or the world. I realised that a lot of my songs were doing that anyway. A lot of witchcraft is about becoming more in-tune with your intuition and putting that into whatever you’re doing creatively.”\n\nSource:\n The world according to Chelsea Wolfe: “Witchcraft helped me find myself”\n\nIn the interview for The Fader Wolfe explained the inspiration behind writting the album: \n"A lot of it was being on the road for so long and then realizing that I hadn’t had a break in a long time and hadn’t had time to take stock of my own life and my own mental and physical health. That’s where the songs began, and after a while it was clear that I needed to stop the train for a second, stop the constant motion and constant travel, and take some time at home. It’s a simple thing, but it felt like a big awakening of sorts — that I really had to learn how to take better care of myself. In order to find healthier ways to survive as a human being, I had to not play some shows for a while." \n\nAs for the album title Birth of Violence she said:\n" At first when it was calling to me, it felt very much like an old book title. I used to work at a used bookstore in high school and I would spend most of my time perusing old books for cool covers and titles like Grapes of Wrath (and) Wuthering Heights. Birth of Violence felt very much in that realm to me. So there was that element to it, but (also) Birth of Violence is a personal awakening, a personal strengthening and coming into my own as a woman. When I looked up the word "violence" in my old dictionary, there was one definition that said "strength of emotion," and I thought that was really cool. Again, I try to think of the word "violence" in a poetic way, like looking at a field of bright orange poppies and violent blue. So I guess it’s kind of about claiming a word that can mean very ugly things and bringing it to a more poetic place."\n\nSource:\n Chelsea Wolfe’s road to the divine feminine <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Chelsea+Wolfe/Birth+of+Violence">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3016 `Is He Real? is IDK's debut studio album. The album was first announced in 2017 and was originally supposed to drop in 2018. When the album was postponed, IDK gave fans "IDK & FRIENDS :)" to hold them over until the album was released.\n\nAs fans grew impatient, IDK posted a website called "IsHeReal.wtf" where fans could track the percentage of the album’s progress. Finally, Is He Real? was released on September 4th, 2019, in honor of Beyoncé’s birthday.\n\nThe album’s title is a play on the word “Israel, meaning "to wrestle with God,” and IDK finds himself struggling with the existence of “He” – or God – during the course of the album’s 35 minutes, but not getting a clear answer. And he invites the album’s featured artists and the album’s listeners to think through the complexities of (their relationship with or belief in) Him.\n\nThe artwork for the album represents this struggle further, as it is a reference to the Sheep and the Goats Parable. Specifically, it is a direct representation of this quote:\n\n“He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” (Matthew 25:33)\n\nIs He Real? is IDK’s first release under his label Clue No Clue, LLC, which is in partnership with Warner Records, and he plans to start signing artists following the release of Is He Real? That being said, this is not his first project distributed by Warner, as IWASVERYBAD was released by his HXLY collective in partnership with BMG and Commission Records, and was ultimately distributed by Warner Music Group. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/IDK/Is+He+Real%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3010 `“I've invented fake news as a genre of music,” Gareth Liddiard observes with a laugh. He’s talking about “Maria 63”, the closing track on Tropical Fuck Storm’s sophomore LP Braindrops. The song takes aim at the once-marginalized alt-right conspiracy theories that now seem to be a driving force behind the rise of fascism in global politics. “It’s about a Mossad agent traveling to Buenos Aires to assassinate Maria Orsic, a Nazi witch who telepathically got the blueprints for warp drive engines from aliens,” Liddiard shares.\n\n“It may be the most stupid song ever written,” Liddiard jokes. He’s wrong, “Maria 63” is emblematic of Tropical Fuck Storm’s keen ability to mine the extreme edge of pop culture’s periphery for potent musical and conceptual spice. Braindrops overflows with compelling sounds and visions that reflect the often dark and fractured reality of life on planet Earth as we hurtle toward environmental and social decay at a frighteningly rapid clip.\n\nTropical Fuck Storm were formed around 2017 in the city of Melbourne, Victoria along Australia’s south-eastern coast. The band released their debut long-player A Laughing Death in Meatspace on Joyful Noise Recordings in 2018. Each of the band’s four members bring considerable experience to the group. Liddiard and Fiona Kitschin were part of the long-running and critically-acclaimed act The Drones, while Erica Dunn and Lauren Hammel have performed in a variety of well-received projects. Perhaps it’s that wealth of rock and roll experience that allows Tropical Fuck Storm to so expertly deconstruct and distort the genre’s norms.\n\n“Everything we do, we try to do it in a weird way. The whole album is full of weird beats, and just weird shit everywhere,” Liddiard explains. He cites Doc at the Radar Station-era Captain Beefheart as a key sonic touchstone, and Braindrops certainly shares the Captain’s penchant for pounding abstract grooves. Tropical Fuck Storm have achieved a uniquely off-kilter sound on Braindrops. Liddiard partly credits this to the group’s use of unconventional equipment, “We use lots of techno gear to make rock and roll because rock and roll gear is boring, and all sounds like Led Zeppelin.”\n\nLiddiard’s own description of Tropical Fuck Storm’s sound is nearly as interesting and evocative as the music itself. He describes the LP’s title track as “Fela Kuti in a car crash,” and talks of creating a sonic atmosphere that “sounds like chloroform smells” for “Maria 62”. Liddiard can be a bit more taciturn when asked to get specific on the group’s lyrical themes. “It's not always a good idea to be too straightforward.” Instead Liddiard favors a “more nebulous and mysterious” approach.\n\nA recurring theme on Braindrops concerns the various ways the human brain can be manipulated and controlled for exploitative gain. The bracing “The Planet of Straw Men” is a study of human behavior inside the social media comments section, a place where otherwise reasonable people are seen gleefully engaging in psychotic chest-thumping rhetoric. “It's about everyone having a screaming match,” Liddiard says. “You see two people yelling at each other on Twitter, but they're not really yelling at each other, they're yelling at each other's idea of the other. Meanwhile countries like Russia are taking advantage of this to push their ideologies and get ahead.” Erica Dunn’s “Who’s My Eugene?” contemplates a more personal example of predatory mind control. “It's about Eugene Landy, the doctor that drugged the shit out of Brian Wilson and emptied his bank account,” Liddiard explains.\n\nWhile Liddiard is careful not to give away too much about the band’s lyrics, he’s confident that audiences will find their own meaning. “If you show a gorilla Hamlet, even if he was capable of reading it, he wouldn't be capable of seeing himself in it. But with humans that's kind of what we do. We have our heads up our own asses.”\n\nListening to Braindrops is a jarring and exhilarating experience, full of pulsating grooves, black humour, dissonant experimentation, and unsettling dystopian plot-lines. Braindrops is an unrelenting work, from an unrelenting musical ensemble. “Tropical Fuck Storm is a full on thing,” Liddiard offers. “Everything we do, we do it to the death.” <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tropical+Fuck+Storm/Braindrops">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3008 'Animated Violence Mild was written throughout 2018, at Blanck Mass’ studio outside of Edinburgh. These eight tracks are the diary of a year of work steeped in honing craft, self-discovery, and grief - the latter of which reared its head at the final hurdle of producing this record and created a whole separate narrative: grief, both for what Benjamin John Power has lost personally, but also in a global sense, for what we as a species have lost and handed over to our blood-sucking counterpart, consumerism, only to be ravaged by it. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Blanck+Mass/Animated+Violence+Mild">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3007 `Fear Inoculum is the fifth studio album by American progressive metal band Tool. It is the band's first album in thirteen years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since 2006's 10,000 Days. The album was released on August 30, 2019.\n\nBackground - Writing:\nIn 2006, Tool released their fourth studio album, 10,000 Days. It topped the US Billboard 200 album chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating more than one million units sold, a month later. The band toured heavily in support of the album, playing more than 200 shows through 2007. After this, front-man Maynard James Keenan mentioned that he saw Tool breaking up in the near future, and focused on his side-project, Puscifer. However, by early 2008, at the 50th Grammy Awards, Keenan announced to MTV that the band would begin writing new material for their fifth studio album "right away."\n\nThe band was quiet over the next few years, only with Tool's website announcing that guitarist Adam Jones, bassist Justin Chancellor, and drummer Danny Carey were working on instrumental material while Keenan focused his efforts on Puscifer. The approach was consistent with what the band had done in the past, with Keenan waiting to write vocals and lyrics until instrumentals were completed. In 2012, the band's website was updated again, with the webmaster writing that they had heard instrumental material that had "sounded like Tool…some of it reminiscent to earlier Tool stuff, with other parts pushing the envelope" and that they estimated that the album was around half done.\n\nVarious outside problems slowed down progress on the album in the coming years. In 2013, it was reported that two separate scooter accidents injured two undisclosed members of the band, eliminating nine days of planned “jamming” time. Carey later revealed himself as one of the involved members, noting that he had been involved in a motorcycle accident that resulted in multiple cracked ribs, which caused him pain that further slowed recording. Keenan summed up the album's progress at the time in a cooking analogy, explaining, "“Basically right now it’s a lot of ideas. There is no actual songs…It's still kind of noodles in a big basket. Lots of noodles, just no dishes.” In 2014, Jones and Carey revealed that complicated legal issues and court battles stemming from a 2007 lawsuit had been slowing down the process as well. The issues stemmed from a lawsuit from a friend who claimed credit for artwork the band had used, but escalated after an insurance company involved sued the band over technicalities, leading to the band then counter-suing the insurance company. The constant court battles and delays, coupled with other life obligations, limited the band's time for working on music, and drained members of their motivation to be creative and write music. At the time, Carey stated that only one song was “pretty much done,” an untitled ten-minute track. In 2015, Jones announced that the legal issues were completely over.\n\nThe four of us are a lot of fucking work, just to get anywhere, oh my god. Everything is a fucking committee meeting and it always is shut down.  success. When you get successful, you think you’re right about everything and you’re pretty sure as that individual — “I am right and you are wrong, because I’m successful and we’re successful because of me, not because of you.” It’s not that bad with us, but there’s a dynamic of like, “I want this and I’ve always gotten my way and that’s why we’re successful, because I don’t compromise on this or that.” I’m the same way. I’m totally the same way.\nMaynard James Keenan, on the creative struggles on writing Fear Inoculum.\n\nWork on the album continued to progress through 2015, albeit “slowly,” according to Keenan. Jones reported that the band had 20 different song ideas being developed. The band toured some, and debuted a new track, “Descending,” albeit in a shortened, incomplete form, according to Jones. Jones also reported that instrumentals had been completed and passed on to Keenan to work on, though he hesitated to call any of the work “done.” While it was reported in early 2016 by the band's webmaster that it was largely just a few shorter songs and interludes that needed finishing, by the end of the year, Chancellor described the band's status as still "deep into the writing process.” He explained that while main themes and a loose "skeleton" had been established, Jones, Carey, and himself were continually creating and reworking new instrumental content. This work on the album continued throughout 2017. At the time, Carey predicted finishing and releasing in mid-2018, while Keenan countered these claims, stating it would likely take longer than that to finish. Jones, Chancellor, and Carey continued to work on the album while Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle in late 2017 to work with Billy Howerdel to record and release their fourth studio album Eat the Elephant in early 2018. By February 2018, Keenan announced that he had received rough music files from the rest of the band members containing instrumentals labeled "FINAL" for all but one track on the album in the prior few months, and had since started writing lyrics and vocal melodies.\n\nRecording:\nOn March 10, 2018, Tool entered a major recording studio to start recording sessions with producer Joe Barresi, whom they had worked with on 10,000 Days. On May 11, it was reported that all drum parts had been tracked. In September, Keenan announced he had finished recording scratch vocals, but had not started final vocal takes. In January 2019, Keenan announced that he had finished his final vocal recording sessions "months ago", but that the album would still likely require lengthy mixing sessions. In the same month, Carey stated that they aimed to release the album in April 2019, though Keenan countered that this was unrealistic, instead pointing to a release between May and July. The band was in the studio with Bob Ludwig in March 2019; Ludwig had also mastered 10,000 Days.\n\nComposition and themes:\nThe album consists of seven main tracks of music, and a run time just short of 80 minutes, the maximum runtime of CDs. The digital version of the album contains three short interlude tracks, stemming from Carey’s scrapped plan to have the album be entirely one long song. Jones and Carey described the songs as lengthy, but containing multiple movements within each track. The concept of seven is a recurring theme of the album both musically and conceptually; Chancellor and Jones wrote guitar riffs in unusual time signatures related to the number seven, while Keenan introduced ideas related to seven as well. Future music videos will also cover the theme. The album also explores the concept of growing "older and wiser." Keenan explained that the album covers the idea of "embracing where we are right now, acknowledging where we've come from and some of the things we've gone through." Keenan also advised that patience and multiple listens were required in understanding the album, comparing it to a slowly developing movie. Jones described it as very different from their prior album (10,000 Days).\n\nRelease:\nThe album's release has been set for August 30, 2019. The band toured in May 2019 in North America. It was reported in March that Jones had been working on album artwork, generally one of the last steps in the process. The band began pre-album release touring in May, kicking it off with a headlining show at Welcome to Rockville, where the band debuted two new songs, "Descending" and "Invincible." The title was announced on July 29, 2019. On August 2, 2019, the band’s back catalog was added to digital download and streaming outlets to promote the release, with the band being one of the few holdouts among major artists. Alex Grey, who also created the art for the band’s prior two albums, created the album’s cover art, revealed on August 5. The album's title track was released on August 7. A deluxe edition of the album, which will come with a full 4-inch HD screen, a 2-watt speaker and a 36-page insert book, was made available for pre-order the same day. The band's European distributor Napalm Records has this available as well.\n\nReception - Professional ratings\nNME 5/5 stars\nJames McMahon of NME gave Fear Inoculum a perfect score, singling out Keenan’s work as “perhaps the best collection of vocals that singer Keenan has ever committed to tape, with many lines exiting the vocalist’s lips closer to the honey daubed croon of Keenan’s...A Perfect Circle than the coarse rasp of yore” and concluding that the album was "worth the wait." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Fear+Inoculum">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It features Slowthai, Deb Never, and the band's members. \n\nOn April 21, 2019, Kevin Abstract tweeted that he started the making of a new BROCKHAMPTON album. In a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, Kevin revealed that he could not finish his solo album, ARIZONA BABY, due to a lack of creativity and needed to work on something else, which marked the beginning of GINGER. In the same interview, producer Jabari Manwa said that he and fellow members Romil Hemnani and Kiko Merley made around 100 songs during the making of GINGER.\n\nIn an interview with GQ in June, Kevin Abstract compared the sound of the album to Outkast's "Hey Ya!", and said the group's approach was taking lyrics about topics like anxiety and depression "and putting it on a song that a bunch of people could dance to". On June 20, thirty seconds of a new song from the album titled "SUGAR" was found on the app TikTok. Some fans also found that the song could be played in digital jukeboxes in some local bars. The full song was leaked online the next day.\n\nOn a GQ episode of "ACTUALLY ME", the band stated that GINGER was their personal favorite out of their projects.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, BROCKHAMPTON revealed the album title in a video posted to their social media. The video consisted of a shot of member Matt Champion tying his shoelaces while a snippet of "LOVE ME FOR LIFE" played in the background. The group performed "BOY BYE" in Spain on their summer festival tour. The group announced that the album would be released in August 2019 in a clip of flashing images of the vocalists, with a snippet of "ST. PERCY", posted to social media on July 18. GINGER merchandise was available on their website starting on July 23.\n\nThe band released the first single, "I BEEN BORN AGAIN", a song featuring all vocalists, on July 31, 2019.

On Kevin Abstract's Instagram Live, various snippets were shown days before the release of GINGER.\n\nThe second single, "IF YOU PRAY RIGHT", was released on August 7, 2019, and has two parts. The music video featured the members playing instruments in space suits on a field and a snippet from another track, titled "HOOD STILL LOVE ME".\n\n"BOY BYE" was added to the International Standard Recording Code database on August 6, 2019 and was released as a single on August 14, 2019. It's one of the rare occasions in BROCKHAMPTON where all current producers and vocalists are on a song together. In an interview with Ryan Seacrest on August 12, the date for Ginger's release was revealed to be August 23, 2019.\n\nThe fourth single, "NO HALO", was released on August 21, 2019, and features vocals from Deb Never and Ryan Beatty. The band held their own "Ginger Radio" on Beats 1 from August 22 to 24. On the release date of GINGER, they had a free live show called "Friday Therapy" at Fonda Theatre where they performed the full album. Guest artists that came and performed included JPEGMAFIA, Dominic Fike, 100 Gecs.\n\nVideos for "HEAVEN BELONGS TO YOU" and "DEARLY DEPARTED" were released on August 26 and 29, respectively. The former was released in tandem with the announcement of their Heaven Belongs to You Tour with special guest slowthai, who also appears in the video. On August 28 and 30, they had interviews for Genius and Power 106 LA.\n\nGINGER debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 dated September 7, 2019, with 77,000 album-equivalent units (including 55,000 pure album sales). GINGER fell to No. 61 in the next week's Billboard 200 chart and was not in the Billboard 200 chart dating to October 5, 2019. The fifth single "SUGAR" peaked at No. 66 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated March 21, 2020 – 7 months after the song's release.

2955 '"ANIMA" is the third solo album by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, released on 27 June 2019 by XL Recordings. Yorke and longtime producer Nigel Godrich developed Anima through live performances and studio work. It was accompanied by a short film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson released on Netflix and in select IMAX theatres.\n\n"ANIMA" focuses on dystopian themes, with the title coming from Yorke’s interest in dreams. According to a June 2019 Zane Lowe interview covered by Pitchfork, Yorke said:\n\n"I think the reason it ended up being called "ANIMA" was partly because I’m obsessed with this whole dream thing, and it comes from this concept that Jung had. But, also, we have started to emulate what our devices say about us and emulate the way we behave from that. So, I had this whole thing where, like, the reason we can watch Boris Johnson lie through his teeth, promise something that we know will never happen is: We don’t have to connect with it directly because it’s a little avatar. It’s this little guy with a stupid haircut waving a flag… ‘That’s all right, that’s funny.’ And the consequences are not real. The consequences of everything we do are not real. We can remain anonymous. We send our avatar out to hurl abuse and poison, and then trot back anonymous.\n\nThe album was teased in mid-June 2019, just over a week before its release, in a number of cryptic ads placed internationally. Musically, the album applies electronic techniques from subgenres such as techno and jungle to his unique style of layered metaphors and oblique references, thus forming a uniquely “Yorkian” creation. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Yorke/ANIMA">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It also peaked at number 43 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nOn "Schlagenheim", black midi craft "cathartic" experimental rock, yielding a "surprising amalgam" of jazz fusion, math rock, noise rock and post-punk.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, "Schlagenheim" received a score of 82, based on 20 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Paul Glynn of the BBC claimed that the album "has been described by critics as everything from thrilling to frustrating." "Schlagenheim" was praised for the technical proficiency of the musicianship, with Paste, Pitchfork, Tiny Mix Tapes and The Guardian singling out Simpson's drumming as especially good.\n\nIn a positive review for Paste, Steven Edelstone says that Greep and Kwasniewski-Kelvin are "two of our most inventive contemporary guitarists" but that one of the few faults of Schlagenheim is that it doesn't "showcase Morgan Simpson’s frenzied drumming to its fullest extent." Edelstone praises Schlagenheim's unpredictability stating ""Schlagenheim" surprises at every turn, never settling into a predictable flow" later comparing it to "Trout Mask Replica" opining that like that album "it doesn’t always sound aurally pleasing, and it’s often tough to keep up, but it rewards those who try." Edelstone says that Schlagenheim is "one of the best albums  ever heard" and "a masterpiece".\n\nIn a mixed review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis praises moments of technical virtuosity in which the band "lock into a groove that manages to be hypnotically repetitious while constantly shifting and changing" but also said of the band "at their least appealing, there’s no doubt that Black Midi can sound pretty pleased with themselves  it’s hard to avoid a sensation of po-faced seriousness, of music that exists largely in order to make its authors and fans feel superior". Petridis concludes ""Schlagenheim" is an imperfect, intriguing debut: behind the overheated prose lurks a young, self-conscious band who clearly aren’t as fully formed as the hype suggests  for all its flaws, Schlagenheim is promising enough to suggest that watching them develop could be fascinating." Joshua Copperman of PopMatters says that although "on talent alone, black midi exceeds the hype" they are "technically proficient but emotionally shallow". Copperman cites "Of Schlagenheim" as an example of this stating that the track "bounces between atmospheric interludes and unhinged screeching but does both extremes no favors. There are so many ideas  that they cancel each other out." He calls "Schlagenheim" "both the most promising and exasperating record of 2019." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/black+midi/Schlagenheim">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2915 `Father of the Bride is the fourth studio album by American indie rock band Vampire Weekend. It was released on May 3, 2019 by Columbia Records as their first album on a major label.\n\nThe release marked the band's first project in nearly six years, following "Modern Vampires of the City", and the group's first project since multi-instrumentalist and producer Rostam Batmanglij's departure from the group. It was primarily produced by Modern Vampires of the City collaborator Ariel Rechtshaid and lead singer Ezra Koenig, and features numerous external collaborators, including Danielle Haim, Steve Lacy, Dave Macklovitch of Chromeo, DJ Dahi, Sam Gendel, BloodPop, and Batmanglij. The pop and indie rock album is musically diverse and heavily referential, contrasting heavy and direct lyrics against a bright spring-time musical mood, with its wide range of influences including country music and jam bands.\n\nThe album was preceded by three double singles: "Harmony Hall / 2021", "Sunflower / Big Blue" and "This Life / Unbearably White". Upon release, it received widespread acclaim from music critics, earning the band their second Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album as well as their first nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It was also a commercial success, becoming the group's third consecutive album to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200. The band promoted the album with a global tour, featuring an expanded seven-person lineup.\n\nThe album's simple cover artwork depicts a globe in a cartoon style that has been compared to the aesthetics of 1960's grass-roots group Another Mother for Peace, 1990's environmentalism and the early internet. The artwork also places emphasis on the Sony Music logo, and has been described as "in keeping with Koenig’s idiosyncratic idea of kitsch". Discussing the cover, Koenig commented that he "always knew  wanted the Earth to be on this raw digital white background", and expressed interest in the idea of "bright, raw whiteness", such as on a blank piece of paper or the peak of a mountain, as well as on digital screens, relating the idea to the track "Unbearably White". He also stated that the artwork relates to the album's motif of ecology, and a nostalgia for the optimism of environmentalism in the 1990's. He initially considered using the poster for anime film "Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special Edition III: Return the World" as the album's artwork, but decided that due to the album's length "the album cover ha to be incredibly simple. Not full of texture and detail". Koenig has likened this simplicity to the covers of other double albums such as the Beatles' "White Album", Fleetwood Mac's "Tusk" and Bruce Springsteen's "The River".\n\nI didn't want it to be a cool photograph of the earth in space, I wanted it to have a little bit of that tension of being Mother Nature, the planet that we live on, but also something border-line uncomfortable with that raw digital whiteness just surrounding it. - Ezra Koenig <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Vampire+Weekend/Father+of+the+Bride">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2888 `No Geography is the ninth studio album by The Chemical Brothers. It is scheduled to be released on 12 April 2019.\n\nThe first single, "Free Yourself", was released in 28 September 2018, with "MAH" (Mad as Hell) following in 7 January 2019. On 1 February they released the third single, "Got to Keep On". On 8 March, The Chemical Brothers released the fourth single, "We've Got to Try".\n*\nIf No Geography is The Chemical Brothers' most daring album in 20 years—and it is—that’s partly due to Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons tapping back into the mid-’90s, a time when they were helping to radically redefine the possibilities for UK dance music. To sow that spirit of experimentalism into their ninth album, the pair exhumed the old samplers they used to make their first two albums. “I set up a corner of my studio that was ‘The 1997 Corner,’” Tom tells Apple Music. “It was very rudimentary, the sort of thing that I’d have set up in my bedroom a long time ago. There’s a particular sound in these old samplers, and their limitations spur you being more creative in how you use samples and throw things together.” Another inspiring throwback was to play unfinished music in their live sets, allowing the songs to evolve and change on stage, as they had done while making 1995’s Exit Planet Dust and Dig Your Own Hole in 1997. The result is uplifting, aggressive, and contemplative, meshing breakbeats, samples, and multiple shades of dance music with a keen understanding of psychedelia and melody. Here, Tom takes us through the album track by track.\n\n“Eve of Destruction”\n“I saw (Norwegian alt-pop singer-songwriter) Aurora on TV, playing at Glastonbury, and I was blown away by the power of her voice and the raw feel she had. She came to the studio and we had such an inspiring time. She was so open to ideas and so full of ideas. She came up with Eve of Destruction as a character, this goddess of destruction. It starts with a discordant voice, but as the track grows, it turns into celebration. The response to this foreboding, forbidding nature of the lyric is to cut loose, to come together, go out and find a friend and be with other like-minded people.”\n\n“Bango”\n“Aurora’s response to playing her bits of music was so unexpected, brilliant, and inspiring. (For ‘Bango’) I’d play her something and she’d come back and with angular words and ideas about unbalanced relationship dynamics and gods bringing thunder upon you. That's the excitement of collaborating with someone—arriving at something that neither of you could have thought of on your own.”\n\n“No Geography”\n“The vocal sample is from a poem by Michael Brownstein, a ’70s New York poet. They did this series called the Dial-A-Poem Poets where you could phone up and have poets read to you. That bit seems to be dealing with the idea that the physical geography between people is not a barrier to their connection. But, yeah, on a bigger scale it’s saying something about people being connected and how we all share something together. It’s recognizing that we are codependent on each other, I suppose.”\n\n“Got to Keep On”\n“You’ve got the sparkly drums and the ‘Got to keep on making me high’ sample (from Peter Brown’s ‘Dance with Me’) and then it has this strange, off-kilter moment in the middle, which was a late night in the studio making everything as deranged as it can be—everything feeding back and all the machines squealing. It’s too much, basically. And when it’s too much, it’s just enough. And then it kind of resolves out and the bells come in. We love to have these really intense kind of psychedelic moments in our music and then it resolves into a joy—you’ve come through it, almost. It’s something that feels very natural to us.”\n\n“Gravity Drops”\n“This is the first breathing moment of the record, really. It’s got heavy beats but the music is moving around, and then you’ve got very full-on d-d-d-drong bits. It all comes from setting up the studio to play it live—we set up lots of instruments and processors so we can play it as a kind of jam and then see where we get to. This is definitely made of trying to have those sections where it just freaks us out. And then we go, ‘Yes, it’s freaked us out.’”\n\n“The Universe Sent Me”\n“Aurora really made this by coming up with these amazing images. Sonics-wise, there are a lot of ideas and a lot of movement. There are moments where it almost feels that whole thing has gone too far, the way it builds and then you’re back down. It’s a rolling psychedelic journey, for want of a better word.”\n\n“We’ve Got to Try”\n“This reminds me of records that we would play at (legendary London club night) The Social when we first started. We’d play quite a lot of soul next to mad acid records. When we were making this track, it really reminded me of that—this idea that we were trying to reach for but never really realized in our own music. If this song had arrived in our record bags, we’d have gone, ‘Wow! This is the sound of what we want to play.’”\n\n“Free Yourself”\n“This samples another Dial-A-Poem poet, Diane di Prima. We loved hearing that vocal in a nightclub. It was exciting to build a new context for that song, to have a new meaning. We played it live a lot in 2018, and that really fed into how the final thing turned out. It’s also got that ‘Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah’ kind of noise. We just like instant delirium noises.”\n\n“MAH”\n“Once, we would probably have felt this was too big a sample to use (the line 'I’m mad as hell and I ain’t going to take it no more' from El Coco’s ‘I’m Mad as Hell’). But the excitement of playing it live and the release of the music after the vocal was an amazing moment. Even though we're not the kind of artists who will be very explicit in what they're feeling, the record was made in a time when, every day, you had constant national discussion and arguments going on. Even though we’re speaking through a sample, another sentiment from another time, when we made the song and put this whole feeling together, it was like, ‘Yeah, that somehow relates to how I'm feeling today.’”\n\n“Catch Me I’m Falling”\n“One of the sampled vocals is by Stephanie Dosen–we worked with her on Further and the score for Hanna–from a Snowbird track, which is her and Simon Raymonde, who used to be in the Cocteau Twins. The other is from (Emmanuel Laskey’s) ‘A Letter from Vietnam,’ this very emotive song from 1968. Stephanie’s singing in a different way—in a different room, in a different time—but the music we've written somehow brings these two disparate things together and makes new sense out of them. But it only makes sense if the thing at the end of it is something you want to listen to, something that moves you.”\n\n(c) EDITORS’ NOTES @ iTunes <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chemical+Brothers/No+Geography">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2883 `"Titanic Rising" is the fourth studio album by American musician Weyes Blood, released on April 5, 2019 by Sub Pop. On January 17, 2019, Weyes Blood released the album's first single, "Andromeda". A second single, "Everyday", was released along with an accompanying self-directed music video on February 12, 2019.\n\nThe album received universal acclaim from critics, garnering an aggregate score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic praising its powerful ambient and vulnerable lyrics.\n\nRecording\nFollowing the release of Front Row Seat to Earth, Natalie Mering signed with Sub Pop in 2017. Titanic Rising was recorded in 2018 over a three month period at Sonora Studios in Los Angeles and was produced by Jonathan Rado. The album named after the RMS Titanic and the 1997 film based on the ship's sinking, which had a profound impact on Mering when she was younger.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nThe album's music has been described as soft rock with influences from 1970s artists such as Joni Mitchell and the Carpenters, as well as chamber pop.\n\nThe opening track "A Lot's Gonna Change," a song that Mering described as setting the overall theme of Titanic Rising, deals with the yearning for a return to the simpler times of childhood, as well as learning how to cope with changes without being bogged down with hopelessness. "Andromeda," inspired by the galaxy and the mythological figure of the same name, deals with finding love in a world of distractions and past disappointments and features a LinnDrum. "Everyday" has an upbeat melody and lyrics about the struggles of online dating. Climate change is also a central theme of the album, with the Titanic used as a metaphor for this.\n\nMering described the title track, an instrumental, as an interlude between the album's first half, which deals with hope and love, and the second half, which deals with "an existential sub-zone." "Movies" features synth arpeggios in the first half before giving way to strings. Lyrically, the song deals with Mering's disillusionment with movies as a teenager and how she felt they lied to her.  "Picture Me Better" is about a friend that committed suicide while Mering was making the album, while the finale track on the album, "Nearer to Thee," is a reference to the alleged final song the band on the RMS Titanic played before the ship sank.\n\nArtwork\nThe album cover features Mering submerged in an underwater bedroom. The cover was photographed by Brett Stanley in a Long Beach, California pool. Commenting on the cover's meaning, Mering stated that she thought of water as symbolizing the subconscious, and that a bedroom lives in this subconscious space due to its role as "a safe (..) and imaginative space" that shapes people's beliefs and identities. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Weyes+Blood/Titanic+Rising">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2878 '"Hiding Places" is a collaborative album from Brooklyn-based rapper billy woods and Los Angeles beat scene veteran Kenny Segal, set for release by Backwoodz Studioz on March 29, 2019. On its face, it seems an unlikely pairing; woods—who moonlights as ½ of dissonant rap duo Armand Hammer—is a chaotic force, the warped relic of an NY indie-rap wave that never happened. Meanwhile, Segal has been in L.A. for twenty years; from paying dues with "Project Blowed" to pushing the culture forward with "Busdriver and Milo". All the while, his soulful, dreamlike production precariously tethered to earth by the right drums or rumbling bass.\n\nBut look closer and it makes more sense. After all, Segal lent his production to a couple of songs on Paraffin, Armand Hammer’s critically-acclaimed opus, and the two veterans have more than a few shared collaborators: Open Mike Eagle, ELUCID, and Hemlock Ernst amongst them. Hiding Places finds both artists deep in the labyrinth. Segal’s lush soundscapes have a new edge, woods’ writing is, paradoxically, at its most direct. Hiding Places is a child’s game: funny and cruel, as brutal as a fairy tale. The album features contributions from both artists’ well of collaborators with ELUCID, Self-Jupiter, and MOTHERMARY making appearances. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Woods/Hiding+Places">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2858 `Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1 is the fifth studio album by British band Foals, released on 8 March 2019 via Transgressive Records and Warner in the UK and North America respectively. The album is considered the first half of a two-piece project, being supplemented by their consecutive sixth studio album Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, to be released in the fourth quarter of autumn 2019. The band promoted the release with a lead single Exits. \n\nThe album's title is taken from the epigraph of the T. Michael Martin novel, The End Games, which claims "Everything not saved will be lost" originated as a "Nintendo 'Quit Screen' message". Although Martin invented the quote and no Nintendo console has ever utilized it, the quote has become a pop culture meme, been featured on the front page of Reddit many times over, served as the name and inspiration for several international art exhibits, and been shared countless times across many social media platforms.\n\nThe album artwork was created by Ecuadorian artist Vicente Muñoz. The image was created using infrared film, which captures infrared signal rather than visible light to contrast vegetation with the built environment. This image is part of his ongoing series, Sublimis, which explores the inevitable struggle of man against nature in the urban environment. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Foals/Everything+Not+Saved+Will+Be+Lost+Part+1">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Confession and self-reflection may be nothing new in rap, but they’ve rarely been done with such skill and imagination. Dave’s riveting and poetic at all times, documenting his experience as a young British black man and pulling back the curtain on the realities of fame."\n\nThe first (start of the session) song is called “Psycho” and the last (end of the session) is called “Drama”.

2823 `Amo (stylised in lowercase) is the sixth studio album by British rock band Bring Me the Horizon. Originally scheduled for release on 11 January 2019, it was released on 25 January 2019. The album was announced on 22 August 2018, a day after the release of the lead single "Mantra". It is produced by frontman Oliver Sykes and keyboardist Jordan Fish, and was written and recorded primarily in Los Angeles.\n\nThe band embarked on the First Love World Tour in 2019 in support of the album. In the 22 August 2018 issue of Kerrang!, they described the album as "varied", "free", "weird" and "mental", with NME noting that "Mantra" continues the electronic and pop rock elements featured on the band's previous studio album, That's the Spirit (2015). "Mantra" subsequently debuted at number one on the UK Rock & Metal Chart, and its video was released on 24 August.\n\nThe album, named after the Portuguese word for "I love", was first promoted by an advertising campaign of billboards across London and other cities worldwide with symbols used by the band in the past on them, along with the words "Do you wanna start a cult with me?", which are lyrics from "Mantra". A website titled joinmantra.org was also launched that stated "Salvation will return", and a phone number that when called featured various audio clips at different times, including one of a woman named Samantha stating "They're making me do this. I didn't know what I was getting myself into."\n\nThe song "Mantra" was subsequently premiered on BBC Radio 1, with Sykes saying to Annie Mac: "It's basically—we've gone off and recorded some stuff and this is the first thing we've wanted to show people of our return. It's quite different but it's got similarities—it's what we wanted to share with the world." Sykes stated that "Mantra" is "not really" representative of the sound of the whole album, also saying "every song on the record is completely different. It’s a lot more experimental than our last record."\n\nSykes stated about the album: "amo is a love album that explores every aspect of that most powerful emotion. It deals with the good the bad and the ugly, and as a result we've created an album that's more experimental, more varied, weird, and wonderful than anything we've done before." He later commented that Amo is a concept album about love, as "Everything boils down to love in the end". Sykes also said that some of the lyrical content concerns his divorce.\n\nAll track titles are stylised in lowercase except for Mantra, which is stylised in all caps.\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bring+Me+the+Horizon/amo">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2800 'Already assured a place on the best of 2003 cd list, The Postal Service’s first album ‘Give Up’, and the group themselves, have experienced a sudden almost startling rising success. They’ve deftly shaken-up America like a gentle, buzzing electrical storm, sending out wonderfully harmonic, wake up world tones from seemingly everyone’s stereos. Originally created as a by mail, almost pen pal style, side project, in only a few short months people have embraced and clamored for this wonderfully grand, unique blend of intelligent electronic music and emotional indie pop.\n\nBy teaming together, The Postal Service has managed to create a sort of Indie Supergroup. By following the typical Dntel m-o, Jimmy Tamborello united talented artists to contribute to his electronic stylings. Apparently, since the team stayed the same throughout each song they decided to give themselves a name and come out as a full-blown side project. All of the players in this postal game come from bands rolling uphill in their own right. The talented sirens Jen Wood, who has a list of credits a mile long including a fairly successful solo career and the singing duties of the former band Tattle Tale, and Jenny Lewis, lead vocalist from Rilo Kiley whose band had an explosion of popularity last year when their latest album received rave reviews from every conceivable publication, add grace tremendously to the album with their angelic voices harmonizing and backing each track, in some cases adding more and turning these electro pop morsels into full blown duets. From the Indie staple group Death Cab For Cutie came background instrumentalist extraordinaire Chris Walla, who has helped make DCFC albums as enjoyable as they have been throughout the years, and singer, guitarist Ben Gibbard. Last year they released a compilation album to a grateful audience, which was a well-received, typical DCFC release, full of scratchy guitars and Ben’s distinct singing, but the typical Death Cab release is very different from what has blossomed here. On Give Up, Chris Walla provides scores of undetectable enhancements to each song and, Gibbard delivers his extremely touching lyrics with such clarity that it’s undeniable what parts of his life you’re looking into. It seems many are surprised that Ben is such a good songwriter! Who knew? You can hear his soft-sung vocals here much better than in a Death Cab For Cutie song, where often the words are overtaken by crunchy instrumentation.\n\nThese songs are riddled with heart and ethereal symphonic beeping that permeates your head and gently massages all the right spots on your brain, while filling your body with a tingling, gravity defying substance. You find yourself floating up high and then you slowly spindrift your way back down to earth on the subtle rises and falls in every goose bump inducing tune. Many of the songs talk about dreaming and sleep, and rightly, the whole album has a very dreamy feel. The single, ‘Such Great Heights’, is the best example of this tonal mind massage as the electronic keys slice daggers through your minds most annoying defenses. All doubt and pompous skepticism are immediately stripped away from even the most jaded music elitist as they’re sucked into pure enjoyment. The song ‘Clark Gable’ speaks of an all too familiar despondence solved with a creative bid at movie magic, when thoughts about how romance maybe isn’t all we were told to believe collide with the desire to maintain the fantasy by a hopeless romantic. But above all ‘Nothing Better’ is the true darling that is even mentioned with hesitance. You’d rather keep this heart-tearing duet, selfishly, all to yourself, before touting it’s gut-wrenching beauty to others.\n\nImpressively, the remarkable combination of these peoples efforts have helped to make The Postal Service stand out in ways their full time projects have not. Not to be taken as a knock to any of these exceptional rising bands, in fact the problem that these bands can’t be knocked is one of the great concerns of this ‘side project’. With such a bubbling pot of boiling hot talent, how could it possibly not risk the danger of spilling over? The mind fills with questions as to the future of this band and the original bands that fans have already come to endear. What will people cry for if the law of supply and demand is tested? Would The Postal Service sound as unbelievable with different performers filling it’s ranks? And predominately what’s on everyone’s mind is: what the hell is this wonderful music?? Where did it come from, how can it possibly be this fresh? The idea of fusing electronic music with emotional singing isn’t an incredible brainstorm. You’ve heard talented people doing it for years. But there is just something profoundly different about this soft, sincere pairing. Maybe it’s the magical combination of these talented individuals, or maybe it’s a glorious niche in style they’ve somehow uncovered, but whatever it is, it’s been exposed to the masses and the people have had their taste. Like an animal who’s tasted human flesh, there is no stopping the insatiable crave for more, after you’ve heard enough of these sounds to permeate and clutch your brain there’s no going back; you’re going to join the throngs of wild humans clamoring for more.\n\n\nReview by, Michael Delgado\n\npurchase and learn more at:: http://www.subpop.com/artists/the_postal_service <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Postal+Service/Give+Up">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 2786 `A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships is the third studio album by English band The 1975. It was released on 30 November 2018 by Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. Initially titled "Music for Cars", the album was intended as the follow-up to "I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It". The term later denoted an era encompassing both their third album and "Notes on a Conditional Form", released in 2020. The band halted recording of the first part after lead singer Matthew Healy left for a drug rehabilitation clinic in Barbados, seeking treatment for his heroin addiction. Following the singer's return, the band spent several months completing the album in Northamptonshire and Los Angeles.\n\nA maximalist experimental album "A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships" combines rock and pop music interspersed with ambient interludes. Eschewing the 1980s-influenced sound of its predecessor, the album embraces a desolate soundscape informed by electronica. Noted for its incorporation of various genres, the record heavily draws from jazz, R&B, electropop, indie rock and Britpop, among others. The songs are characterised by their electronic beats, gospel choirs, neo-soul horns and downtempo rhythms. Guest contributions are featured from the London Community Gospel Choir, No Rome, the Japanese House and Roy Hargrove.\n\nExploring the role of digital communication and the internet in contemporary life "A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships" is a concept album connected by several over-arching threads. The album serves as a cautionary political statement, questioning the implications of society's relationship with technology and its impact on millennials. It marks a shift in Healy's portrayal of heroin addiction, embracing sincerity and honesty to speak on the desolation it causes. Eschewing metaphors and ambiguity, the album utilises black humour, simple lyrics and straightforward storytelling, covering dark topics such as nihilism, suicide, depression, anxiety, dissociation, trauma, cynicism and death, among others.\n\n"A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships" was preceded by the singles "Give Yourself a Try", "Love It If We Made It", "TooTimeTooTimeTooTime", "Sincerity Is Scary" and "It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)". The album received widespread acclaim from contemporary music critics, who praised the production quality and portrayal of modern life, with some critics calling it a millennial version of Radiohead's OK Computer. In addition to appearing on numerous publications' year-end and decade-end lists, it won the British Album of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. The album became the 1975's third consecutive number one on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart and attained top-ten positions in several countries, including on Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. To further promote the album, the band embarked on their Music for Cars Tour. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+1975/A+Brief+Inquiry+Into+Online+Relationships">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 2784 `There’s something painterly about 19 year-old producer Kai Whiston’s hyper-surrealist beat music, with each sound being contorted and manipulated to the point that would rather reflect the mark-making of a De Kooning piece than any genre-focused electronic scenes. After exploring the ideas of adolescent fury on ‘Fissure Price’ EP --Released on Big Dada last year-- and facing the dramas of the UK justice system after a brief false imprisonment, Whiston’s rupturing abrasion refuses to take it’s foot off the pedal. Across 40 minutes, his maximalist pastiche spans across the entire LP, drawing fractured influences from Arca, Hudson Mohawke, Death Grips, Timbaland, nu-metal and so much more. Whiston returns after a plethora of cosigns from the likes of Iglooghost, Noisia, Skrillex, Danny Brown, Kanye West, Anthony Fantano, Mary Anne Hobbs, Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park and many more. The moombahton inspired ‘Your Secrets’ features underground pop specialist Clarence Clarity, whose production was littered all over Rina Sawayama’s acclaimed 2017 project  ‘RINA.\n\nOn his debut album, Whiston says “This is the collective pursuit of every irrational primitive desire and instinct that we all face.. Kai Whiston Bitch is my voice of self indulgence that develops beyond any evaluative insight, with every disregard of being civilised. Being a dickhead has never felt so romantic.”\n\n-----------\n\n“There’s something about the gummy, crackling tangle of tactile sound that gives Dorset-based Whiston’s music an exhilarating sense of stringy overindulgence.” - AQNB\n\n“The 18-year-old producer, who has already received co-signs from Brainfeeder affiliate Iglooghost and BBC Radio's Mary Anne Hobbs, engorges the stereo field in the session, dripping and twisting murky globs of sound in an abstract, expressive manner” - THUMP\n\n“Melding the maniacal patchwork production style of Aphex Twin with the hyper-glossy aesthetic of Danny L Harle, 18-year-old Dorset producer Kai Whiston is serious about being silly.” - Crack Magazine\n\n“Transporting you to a head-spinning, bone-rattling netherworld, we're not sure if we're more intimidated by his youth or his knack for making us feel like we're Rosemary's baby” - PAPER Magazine\n\n“Whiston's music embraces post-internet aesthetics: scattershot sounds plucked from a spectrum of references, altered and placed in collage with a digital sheen” - Resident Advisor <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kai+Whiston/Kai+Whiston+Bitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 2780 'DUMMY BOY is 6ix9ine’s highly-anticipated debut studio album and the follow-up to his February 2018 release, DAY69. After an announcement on Twitter from Tekashi’s close friend and media personality DJ Akademiks, the project officially released on November 27, 2018. The album’s title seemingly stems directly from a line in one of his hit singles, “TATI”:\n\n"Dummy boys fall in love with it, he stupid"\n\nOn November 7, 2018, 6ix9ine announced the project on his Instagram, revealing both its cover art designed by artist Alex Solis and its release date.

The project, however, did not drop on the announced release date of November 23, 2018, due to his unforeseen arrest for racketeering and firearms offenses.

 2776 `Simulation Theory is the eighth studio album by English rock band Muse. It was released on 9 November 2018 through Warner Bros. Records and Helium-3. Co-produced by the band with Rich Costey, Mike Elizondo, Shellback, and Timbaland, it is a synth-rock album with themes of simulation and centering on the idea of "fantasy becoming real". Contrasting the band's previous three albums which dealt with darker themes, the band sought lighter influences from science fiction and 1980s pop culture and produced the album one track at a time without a focus on a greater narrative or theme. Recording began at AIR Studios in London in early 2017 with Elizondo, creating three tracks before embarking on a midyear tour of North America. Production restarted in Los Angeles in late 2017 with Costey, who had co-produced Muse's albums Absolution (2003) Black Holes and Revelations (2006). Muse wanted to combine elements from multiple eras. The contemporary political climate of the United States informed the music and lyrics.\n\nThe album cover for Simulation Theory, designed by Stranger Things artist Kyle Lambert, and its music videos, directed by Miike Snow and Twin Shadow collaborator Lance Drake, shared the album's 1980s pop culture and science fiction influences, homaging Back to the Future, Critters, Ghostbusters, Max Headroom, Michael Jackson's Thriller, and Teen Wolf. The album was preceded by the release of singles "Dig Down", "Thought Contagion", "Something Human", "The Dark Side", and "Pressure", along with a 2018 festival tour of North America. It was released in a standard edition alongside two deluxe editions featuring alternate versions of its tracks.

The concept was thought-out by the singer herself and friend Ferran Echegaray. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/ROSAL%C3%8DA/El+Mal+Querer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2755 `You Won't Get What You Want is the fourth studio album by American rock band Daughters. It was released on October 26, 2018, through Ipecac Recordings. It is the band's first album since they broke up in late 2009. The album was released to universal critical acclaim, with many critics naming it one of the best albums of 2018. It marks a significant departure from the band's earlier style, moving away from mathcore towards a more industrial and noise rock influenced sound.\n\nThe album was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 87, based on 11 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim". The album was included on numerous end-of-year lists as one of the best albums of 2018. Pitchfork wrote that "Similar to their Providence art-metal contemporaries in the Body, Daughters’ accessibility is directly proportional to their uncompromising compositional choices—hypnotic dissonance, martial drums cranked to incapacitating volumes, scathing vocal repetition, all rendered through impossibly vivid production. This is not music interesting in growing on you: it consumes and dominates." PopMatters called it "the perfect return for Daughters. While aspects of the band's creative vision have been altered and their sound has further evolved, the core elements remain intact. The asphyxiating sound has been augmented with the inclusion of longer, heavier sludge influenced moments. The tension the band build is further explored through different means."\n\nCredits (adapted from liner notes):\n\nAll lyrics written by Alexis Marshall; all music composed by Nick Sadler.\n\nDaughters: \nAlexis S.F.

Explaining the album title, Nergal said that "It’s a verse from the Bible, it’s actually a quote from Jesus Christ himself.

2730 'YSIV (an initialism of Young Sinatra IV) is Logic’s fourth studio album and the fourth (and final) entry in the Young Sinatra series. The album was released on September 28, 2018. This is Logic’s second release of 2018, following Bobby Tarantino II in March, marking the first time he has released two projects in the same year. YSIV is separate from his previously announced album Ultra 85, which is now scrapped.\n\nLogic released the album’s lead single, “One Day,” which features Ryan Tedder, on July 27, 2018.\n\nHe then followed “One Day” with “The Return” on August 24, 2018, aptly titled because it was his official return to the Young Sinatra persona. However, Young Sinatra had already made a return earlier in 2018 when he was ‘featured’ on “Warm It Up.”\n\nFollowing the release of the first two singles, rumors began that Logic was preparing to release a project soon. On August 28, 2018, Logic surprise-released “YSIV Freestyle,” both confirming YSIV’s existence and announcing its release date. Logic released the album’s third single, “Everybody Dies,” on September 7, 2018.\n\nLogic revealed the album’s tracklist on social media on September 24, 2018. The fourteen track album boasts features from fellow DMV native Wale, Jaden Smith, and, quite remarkably, the entire living Wu-Tang Clan. Frequent collaborators such as Big Lenbo and Lucy Rose also make appearances.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Sam Spratt, who has created all of Logic’s artwork since 2014, revealed that YSIV (along with Bobby Tarantino II and Ultra 85) was hinted at on the cover of Logic’s May 2017 album Everybody. This indicates that all of these projects have been in the works since before May 2017. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Logic/YSIV">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2720 `iridescence is the fourth studio album by American band BROCKHAMPTON, released on September 21, 2018, by Question Everything, Inc. and RCA Records, as the first installment of "The Best Years of Our Lives" trilogy. The self-produced album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, as well as the group's own studio in Hawaii. It is their major label debut as well as their first album since Ameer Vann's departure following sexual misconduct allegations. \n\nThe album marked BROCKHAMPTON's first number-one album, as the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 Chart. The album sold 101,000 copies in its first week and was released just weeks before the band embarks on their first tour without ex-member Ameer Vann.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, BROCKHAMPTON announced their fourth studio album "Team Effort" slated for release in 2018, but in March 2018, they announced that Team Effort had been delayed. On March 20, Kevin Abstract and other members posted a "work-in-progress" album cover of "PUPPY", scrapping the name "Team Effort" completely. "PUPPY" was set to be released sometime in June. The next week, they announced via social media that they had signed a record deal with Sony's RCA Records, a deal reportedly worth $15 million for six albums over three years.

2715 `Noname releases her highly anticipated debut album, Room 25. The 11-track album was executive produced by fellow Chicago native Phoelix and sees Noname return as a more mature and experienced artist. Room 25 has received early praise from The New York Times, calling her a "Full-Fledged Maverick" in their Critic's Pick review yesterday. Noname also recently opened up in The FADER's Fall Fashion issue about her life since the release of her 2016 mixtape Telefone.\n\nRather than cash in on the hype around her extremely well-received 2016 debut mixtape Telefone, Noname took two years to play shows backed by a full band and refine her craft before releasing her follow up project. Over the last few months anticipation for her new album steadily built with Noname dropping a stream of hints that its release was approaching. Telefone established Noname as one of the most promising and unique voices in hip hop, and with Room 25 she stakes out her place as one of the best lyricists in the genre and comes into her own as a fully realized artist as she achieves mastery over the style she developed with her first tape.\n\nRoom 25 arrives a little over two years after Noname released her breakout mixtape Telefone. Upon its release, Telefone received nearly universal acclaim and propelled Noname to become one of the most exciting new voices in music. The intimate mixtape cut through the noise of an oversaturated musical landscape like few other releases have in the last several years. Since the release of Telefone, Noname has built an international presence, successfully touring the world and playing the top festivals. In 2017, she also touched the Saturday Night Live stage alongside collaborator and childhood friend Chance the Rapper to perform a song of his Colouring Book album. The New York Times called her SNL performance "a master class in poise, delivery, and self-assuredness." <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noname/Room+25">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2710 `The iconic I Want To Die In New Orleans is $UICIDEBOY$‘ debut album and 43rd project. This record particularly makes more use of choruses and ad-libs than their usual work. It follows the boys making references to their hometown of New Orleans; multiple songs on the album feature an outro related to the city at the end of the track, segueing into the next.\n\nThe album was originally going to be named “I Don’t Want To Die In New Orleans”, the name change came as a shock when the boys posted this to their respective social media: \n\n"We started recording this album in the beginning of 2017. Initially we wanted to write about our experiences on the road and express how our lives had become slightly more extravagant. When the original release date for the album approached, we realized that the album didn't capture that chapter of our lives correctly.\n\n After traveling the globe on two back to back sold out world tours, amassing a fortune, spending an insane amount of money on drugs, losing friends, making enemies and witnessing this scene that we helped create turn into what it is now, we have decided that none of this fame or money will ever make us happy. \n\nFor a second there we thought it would. \n\nTherefore, we are changing the album title to..."\n\nAlong with the switch of the name, they also announced around the same time that there would be no features on the album, tweeting: "0 features, 0 collabs, no one on this mortal plane is worthy".\n\nAlong with the album came a vinyl press, a CD copy and casette of every track, fit with the album artwork. However, the album was still uploaded to the boys respective streaming platform discographies and uploaded for free-listening on their Soundcloud.\n\nThe album also met with a tour, along with pop-up shops selling merchandise of which was also sold separately online. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/$uicideboy$/I+Want+To+Die+In+New+Orleans">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2704 `Joy as an Act of Resistance is the second studio album by British rock band Idles, released on 31 August 2018 by Partisan Records. The album peaked at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart on 7 September 2018.\n\nThe band started recording the album in 2017. Singer Joe Talbot stated "This album is an attempt to be vulnerable to our audience and to encourage vulnerability; a brave naked smile in this shitty new world". According to Talbot "lots of songs got scrapped because there was this pressure, which we were carrying but not talking about. We were trying to sustain the success of Brutalism, to basically remake it. So we kind of scrapped all the songs and talked about why we weren't enjoying writing it".\n\nThe album was produced by Space and mixed by Adam Greenspan and Nick Launay. The album's cover art features a photograph of a fight at a wedding in 1968 that Talbot saw on Instagram. The title phrase is similar to the title of the 2008 poem, "Joy Is An Act of Resistance" (part of a series of poems called "The Telly Cycle") by Pushcart Prize-winning poet Toi Derricotte, whose work as a Black woman explores race and identity. The album's lyrics deal with toxic masculinity, love, self-love, immigration, Brexit, and class. June deals with the death in childbirth of Talbot's daughter Agatha. It also includes a cover version of the Solomon Burke hit Cry To Me.\n\nJordan Bassett, reviewing the album for NME, awarded the album five stars, calling it "an instant classic". Dave Simpson, for The Guardian gave it four stars, describing it as "11 songs of focused, cathartic rage, rooted in their own experiences", and calling Idles "Britain’s most necessary band". Mark Beaumont of The Independent also gave it four stars. Dom Gourlay, for Drowned in Sound, called it "one of 2018's most eagerly anticipated releases", awarding it a score of 9 out of 10, and going on to say that it is "everything anyone could have wanted or expected it to be: Idles have released the most relevant and at times gut wrenching album of the year". Classic Rock magazine gave it the same score, calling it "a heart-breaking but jubilant exploration of joy, honesty, fragility and expression as our most powerful means of human resistance". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/IDLES/Joy+as+an+Act+of+Resistance.">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2703 `Slide is the second album by American electronic musician George Clanton, released on August 17, 2018 by his independent record label 100% Electronica.\n\nAfter releasing his debut album 100% Electronica, George Clanton tried to produce a sequel to it for three years but found it difficult because he wasn't able to find the sound he wanted for it. After giving up, he started experimenting and writing stuff for fun and felt that the "songs  themselves". This material became the basis for Slide. Clanton said that Slide was the first album he wrote under his own name, since his debut album was written as a Mirror Kisses record before he decided to release it under his real name.\n\nClanton said that in Slide he did not try to be "ironic" or "silly with his lyrics", and preferred to "write great pop songs that are representative of an emotion that  actually  when  singing them." He has said that a lot of Slide was written "freestyle" and that the lyrics of it are "really vague and come from deep down sometimes from a subconscious place."The album features electric guitars, acoustic drums, samples and synthesizers. Clanton described Slide as "a vaporwave opera".\n\nClanton premiered Slide on August 18, 2018 in front of a sold out audience at the Elsewhere music venue in Brooklyn, New York City.

2702 `"Kamikaze" (stylized as KAMIKAZƎ) is the tenth studio album by American rapper  Eminem, released on August 31, 2018, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records, and without prior announcement. The album features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon.  Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production for individual tracks comes from a variety of musicians.\n\nFollowing the polarizing reception of his previous album, Revival (2017), music journalists debated over whether the rapper's relevance and ability were waning. In response to the criticism,  Eminem released a remix of the song "Chloraseptic" in January 2018 with 2 Chainz and Phresher. Kamikaze represents a continuation of this response, containing various insults against critics and rappers alike. The artwork is an homage to Beastie Boys' debut album, Licensed to Ill (1986).\n\nKamikaze received generally mixed reviews from critics. Some praised it as an improvement over the rapper's previous album and a welcome return to the sound of his earlier, more aggressive material, while others criticized its lack of adaption to the current sound of hip hop, as a result, found it outdated. The album also generated some controversy for its diss tracks about various artists, as well as spurring accusations of homophobia.\n\nThe album was promoted with three singles: "Fall", "Venom", from the 2018 movie of the same name, and "Lucky You", and a music video for "Good Guy", along with a supporting tour. Commercially, the album reached number one in 18 countries, becoming Eminem's ninth consecutive number-one album in the United States, and later becoming the best-selling hip-hop album of 2018. It later received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nRecording and release\nOn January 8, 2018, Eminem unexpectedly released a remix to his Revival song, "Chloraseptic", featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher. In the song, Eminem mocked critics of Revival, concluding "I just added to the fuel in my rocket pack, till I'm ready to respond then I'ma launch it at 'em... I'll be back..." On January 22, 2018, photos revealed Mike Will Made-It in the studio with Eminem and Dr. Dre. During the Revival sessions, S1 tried to work with Eminem but he refused; the producer kept sending him beats to use on future tracks that the rapper incorporated into Kamikaze songs. The afternoon before Kamikaze's release, Eminem posted a 15-second teaser of a new song on social media, featuring the logo for the superhero film Venom, without comment.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, he released the album to digital music stores and streaming services without any promotion or pre-announcement, unlike the extensive marketing done for Revival; he would repeat the strategy with 2020's Music to Be Murdered By. Billboard credits the success of the surprise release to Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album released in December 2013 without any promotion or pre-announcement, which was a critical and commercial success, ultimately changing the global release day for music from Tuesday to Friday. The album was sold on his website in several formats, including bundled with merchandise such as apparel. Eminem used social media services such as Instagram and Twitter to announce the release and has relied on extensive feedback from diss tracks and Internet hype to spread the word of the album.

Predictable. In the end, what felt true was to say that we as a society and as a species are probably an accident, a mutation. Really what we are is fucking animals. And the illusion was enlightenment. The more we’ve connected with each other the dumber we’ve gotten and the more we decide we want to kill each other. We’re not some elevated transcendent beings, we’re bacteria in a jar. I wanted the art direction of Bad Witch to feel like shadows on a cave wall and we’re trying to figure out what it is and really there’s no nice, clean, safe scientific explanation. We’re just an accident. String theory and quantum physics is a fucking trick. And we’re not going to suddenly elevate ourselves into transcendent beings. We’re kidding ourselves. I know this will be an unsatisfying conclusion for some people. It isn’t what they want. They want it to be full matrix virtual reality, and this is the opposite of that, this is dirt and a broken computer chip and everything you believe in is really just bullshit."

However, the video's extremely explicit nature led to YouTube taking down the video and giving Death Grips' channel a community strike, after which the band re-uploaded the music video to Vimeo. The album leaked online on 21st June, and was officially released on streaming platforms on 22nd June, as well as on Death Grips' YouTube. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Grips/Year+of+the+Snitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2623 'ye is Kanye West’s eighth solo studio album. The album discusses topics in Kanye’s life, including mental health, family, and addiction. He also explicitly announces his diagnosis with bipolar disorder through the album’s artwork and a proclamation within the album.\n\nThe seven-song project was premiered on June 1, 2018, at an exclusive listening party hosted in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the album was primarily created. This listening party was also live-streamed on WAV Media. At the listening party, comedian Chris Rock announced that the album was simply titled ye, although the title had initially been teased as LOVE EVERYONE. Unbeknownst to fans, Kim Kardashian, Kanye’s wife, had teased the title hours prior to the announcement.\n\nIn an interview with Big Boy conducted during the Wyoming festivities, Kanye explained his decision to name the album ye:\n\n"I believe ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and, in the Bible, it means ‘you,’ so it’s “I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.” It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just ye – just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything, that I’m just more of a reflection of who we are, just as beings."\n\nKanye also revealed in this interview that after his infamous TMZ interview (in which he stated that he believes slavery was a choice), he completely re-did his album with an entirely new theme. The fate of the original songs is currently unknown.\n\nye is the second album in a five-album series of releases that are entirely produced by Kanye. It was preceded by Pusha-T’s DAYTONA, and succeeded by KIDS SEE GHOSTS (his collaborative album with Kid Cudi), Nas‘ NASIR, and Teyana Taylor’s K.T.S.E.\n\nThe existence of the album was initially made public on April 19, 2018, when Kanye tweeted the expected release date.\n\nOn May 15, 2018, Kanye tweeted a video displaying the working tracklists for his upcoming projects, his labeled “Ye.” At the time the video was shot, only two songs had been added to Ye’s album: “Wouldn’t Leave” and “Extacy” (which was later retitled “XTCY” and released on August 11, 2018). The video also displayed “Ghost Town” as a track on Ye and Kid Cudi’s collaborative album KIDS SEE GHOSTS, but it now appears as track 6 on ye.\n\nOn June 10, 2018, ye became Kanye’s 8th consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/ye">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In an interview with GQ, Rocky stated: "My new album is really about testing new sounds. People are scared to test new sounds, so they go with what's current 'cause it's the easy thing to do. The top 100 songs sound a certain way. People cater more to that because it's a bigger demographic behind that, or it's a guaranteed demographic behind that. I prefer to experiment and have my crowd grow with me and to reach new crowds. I don't just rap—I actually make music. That's why it takes time. These sonics represent me."\n\nThe album artwork was unveiled on May 21, 2018, featuring a photo by Houston-based creative director Cary Fagan.

2604 `7 is the seventh studio album by American dream pop duo Beach House. The band have the following to say about it: \n\n"7 is our 7th full-length record. At its release, we will have been a band for over 13 years. We have now written and released a total of 77 songs together. \n\nLast year, we released an album of b-sides and rarities. It felt like a good step for us. It helped us clean the creative closet, put the past to bed, and start anew. \n\nThroughout the process of recording 7, our goal was rebirth and rejuvenation. We wanted to rethink old methods and shed some self-imposed limitations. In the past, we often limited our writing to parts that we could perform live. On 7, we decided to follow whatever came naturally. As a result, there are some songs with no guitar, and some without keyboard. There are songs with layers and production that we could never recreate live, and that is exciting to us. Basically, we let our creative moods, instead of instrumentation, dictate the album’s feel. \n\nIn the past, the economics of recording have dictated that we write for a year, go to the studio, and record the entire record as quickly as possible. We have always hated this because by the time the recording happens, a certain excitement about older songs has often been lost. This time, we built a "home" studio, and began all of the songs there. Whenever we had a group of 3-4 songs that we were excited about, we would go to a “proper” recording studio and finish recording them there. This way, the amount of time between the original idea and the finished song was pretty short (of the album’s 11 songs, 8 were finished at Carriage House in Stamford, CT and 2 at Palmetto Studio in Los Angeles). \n\n7 didn’t have a producer in the traditional sense. We much preferred this, as it felt like the ideas drove the creativity, not any one person’s process. James Barone, who became our live drummer in 2016, played on the entire record. His tastes and the trust we have in him really helped us keep rhythm at the center of a lot of these songs. We also worked with Sonic Boom (Peter Kember). Peter became a great force on this record, in the shedding of conventions and in helping to keep the songs alive, fresh and protected from the destructive forces of recording studio over-production/over-perfection. \n\nThe societal insanity of 2016-17 was also deeply influential, as it must be for most artists these days. Looking back, there is quite a bit of chaos happening in these songs, and a pervasive dark field that we had little control over. The discussions surrounding women’s issues were a constant source of inspiration and questioning. The energy, lyrics and moods of much of this record grew from ruminations on the roles, pressures and conditions that our society places on women, past and present. The twisted double edge of glamour, with its perils and perfect moments, was an endless source (see “L’Inconnue,” “Drunk in LA,” “Woo,” “Girl Of The Year,” “Last Ride”). \n\nIn a more general sense, we are interested by the human mind's (and nature’s) tendency to create forces equal and opposite to those present. Thematically, this record often deals with the beauty that arises in dealing with darkness; the empathy and love that grows from collective trauma; the place one reaches when they accept rather than deny (see “Dark Spring,” “Pay No Mind,” “Lemon Glow,” “Dive,” “Black Car,” “Lose Your Smile”). \n\nThe title, 7, itself is simply a number that represents our seventh record. We hoped its simplicity would encourage people to look inside. No title using words that we could find felt like an appropriate summation of the album. \n\nThe number 7 does represent some interesting connections in numerology. 1 and 7 have always shared a common look, so 7 feels like the perfect step in the sequence to act as a restart or “semi-first.” Most early religions also had a fascination with 7 as being the highest level of spirituality, as in "Seventh Heaven.” At our best creative moments, we felt we were channeling some kind of heavy truth, and we sincerely hope the listeners will feel that. \n\nMuch Love, \n\nBeach House" <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Beach+House/7">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2603 `Die Lit is the debut studio album by the American rapper Playboi Carti, released on May 11, 2018, through AWGE Label and Interscope Records, following his successful summer debut self-titled mixtape. The album was announced by Carti on Twitter the night before it's release.\n\nThis album contains features such as Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert and Travis Scott.

The album is largely produced by a frequent collaborator of Carti's, Pi'erre Bourne. The cover art for Die Lit was shot by Nick Walker, who wanted to recreate the photo of an old punk rock concert to match the album's aesthetic.\n\nDie Lit is considered an album that changed the trap production style and still a big influence to others hip-hop/rap artists. The album debuted at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, and Shoota debuted at No. 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti/Die+Lit">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2587 `Eat the Elephant is the fourth studio album by American rock band A Perfect Circle. It is their first album release in fourteen years, after 2004's Emotive. While early work on new material traces back to as early as 2008, years of slow progress would ensue due to issues between the band's chief music writers, frontman Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Billy Howerdel, largely stemming from their commitments to other projects and inability to come to an agreement on the direction to take the band. Renewed focus, alongside assistance from music producer Dave Sardy, helped propel the band into much more productive sessions across 2017, with the album being completed in early 2018. Thematically, the album covers a variety of Keenan's views on modern societal, religious, and political issues, focusing on his perceived lack of accountability in humanity. Musically, the album was viewed as an extension and maturation of their rock sound, adding more piano and electronic elements into songs for a more mellow sound than prior albums.\n\nThe album was released on April 20, 2018. Four singles were released in advance of the album – "The Doomed" in October 2017, "Disillusioned" in January 2018, "TalkTalk" in February 2018, and "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" in April 2018. The album was generally well-received by critics, who praised the album for being a successful comeback album, and the maturation in the band's sound, though some lamented the lack of more hard rock songs from band's prior work. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/A+Perfect+Circle/Eat+the+Elephant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2585 'KOD is J. Cole’s long-anticipated fifth studio album. The 12-track album serves as a follow up to his 2016 album, 4 Your Eyez Only. Unlike his last two albums, KOD has a lone feature from an artist named kiLL Edward—a pitched-down version of Cole’s voice that serves as his alter ego.\n\nLeading up to the album debut, Cole hosted many exclusive listening events where he played the project in full. According to Chris Uño, who was in attendance at J. Cole’s surprise listening party at New York’s Grammercy Theatre, the “KOD” title can be taken three different ways:\n\n• Kids On Drugs\n• King OverDosed\n• Kill Our Demons\n\nThe album’s release date of April 20, 2018, could be a reference to the “420” code in cannabis culture, which includes smoking at 4:20 p.m. and on April 20th. The album’s cover art, speculated album title abbreviations, and frequent mentions of drug use in lyrics of songs support this notion.\n\nChris Uño also reported that the album was recorded in the span of two weeks, and contains no features, making it his third album in a row to not contain guest features. This report turned out to be somewhat true. The album’s only listed feature is KiLL edward, who turned out to actually be J. Cole, pitched down.\n\nFollowing the listening party, Cole took to Twitter to announce the album. The album art and tracklist were revealed on April 18th, two days before the album released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole/KOD">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
