        let replacedStr = `The new highly anticipated collab album between Portland rapper Aminé and Haitian Canadian music producer KAYTRANADA, both of whom had mid 2010 breakouts that ran along very different trajectories. While Aminé has had quite a bit of mainstream success, to this day there's still sort of a low-key, underground, stoner rap demeanor about him, with lots of laid back, slick and clever rhymes that don't sound like they're desperate for anyone's attention, but still hit and are worth replaying. Meanwhile, KAYTRANADA is handily one of the most versatile hip-hop adjacent producers out there today. So versatile his work is often hard to categorize as any one thing: a lot of dance fusion styles being worked into the grooves of his beats. His breakout record "99.9%" was released on XL Records, if that tells you anything, and landed features not only from the likes of Phonte and Vic Mensa, but this record also made space for dance and pop act, such as Little Dragon, as well as AlunaGeorge. In theory, this potentially is a hot little collaboration that we have here. Not only because Aminé's energy will most likely match the low-key vibe of KAYTRANADA's beats — there's even a line of Aminé saying that he asked him for some free beats back in 2015 — but Aminé also tends to thrive on production that is at least a little left field or unusual. That's KAYTRANADA, this thing should be fire. But it's not, it's just okay. Which is unfortunate, because listening to this thing it's one of those records that could have been a lot better, especially if the deep cuts were going as hard as the singles and the highlights. Because as it currently stands, this "KaytrAminé" project is a little scant at 33 minutes of runtime. And it's the singles and the feature cuts that pack the most punch. Be that "4EVA" with Pharrell, which is a vaguely tropical bop with bump and keys and some hooky vocal chops from Williams. Aminé's bars are consistently funny and flirty, whether he is spitting lines about pussy percussion or Stacey Dash's garbage political takes. Not exactly lyrically focused or anything like that, but the track overall is blissful and feel good. With "letstalkaboutit", we have more head-notting beats, dreamy keys and smooth flows from Aminé that are so understated, he makes it all sound effortless, even when his rhyme schemes and rhythms are getting pretty tight. However, Freddie Gibbs goes even harder in the second half of the track, stealing the show. Which also happens on the song "Master P" featuring Big Sean, where KAYTRANADA's production also carries with simple and crispy snares and hi-hats sitting at the center of whirlwind, made of reverse descending melodies and ghostly androgynous vocal leads, which makes me wish more of the beats on this thing were this colorful and out there. Truth be told, some of the production on this project came across more skeletal and underwhelming, half baked than I thought it would. To the point where it takes the wind out of the song's sails. Be it on the opener "Who He Iz", which sets an inadvertently sleepy tone for the entire project, which is perplexing given that the opening vocal snippet that kicks the entire record off would lead you to think you were going to hear Aminé and KAYTRANADA go in, hit us with an explosion right off the bat. But that could not be further from the actual results that we see. "Westside" features a very pretty, nice, distant little string sample throughout the track, but the beat itself is one of the stiffest and driest on the entire record. And Aminé didn't exactly use this extra space to fill this vacuum with super standout bars or anything. The "bust out the troops" is hilarious. But outside of that, we have some weak similes to "Sister Sister" and "Sex in the City". "Rebuke" was a snoozer of a song interlude on the project. And we also have "Sossaup", which is maybe the most annoying song on the entire thing, with a very sour two chord progression playing throughout much of the track and a beat that is so tense I can't vibe to it at all, it makes me feel like I'm sitting in a Brazilian dentist office waiting for a root canal. However, "STFU3" is one of the few moments that is so low-key, but also standout and eccentric. The song sounds like what you would get if Pharrell and Clipse had to assemble a track for the "Twilight Zone": it's got kooky, bassy, minimal production. Meanwhile, Aminé brings nothing, but charisma for two solid verses, has some funny bars and out of breath refrains throughout the track that are cool, even if the pacing of the track is a little tedious and didn't need to be this long. The closing moments of the record I didn't think were that interesting. "K&A", the longest track here by a mile, but finishes the record off as unceremoniously as it starts. In fairness, the beat is relatively mesmerizing and we do get some self-affirming food for thought from Aminé in the verses. But in practice the whole thing is big, dreamy diatribe with no real point or sense of direction, an unearned victory lap. And then, there's a bold beat switch in the last leg of the song that doesn't even fit the rest of the track in tone, it feels super tacked on. Overall, I'll say that there are some moments that are fireworks, there are others where either KAYTRANADA or Aminé are playing it a little too easy going. And as a result, the bars or, vice versa, the beat carry. Not to mention Aminé is usually outshined by the guest features pretty handily, even on "EYE" featuring Snoop Dogg, even though what Snoop hands in is pretty standard as far as his features go these days.
