This is a new mixtape of material from Detroit Duo Snow Strippers, which is masterminded by producer Graham Perez and vocalist Tatiana Schwaninger. These two have been making intense waves in the electronic music underground as of late, somehow mustering enough buzz to land a little Uzi vert feature and they only dropped their debut album last year and now they're following it up with this project right here less than 12 months later and I'm hearing a lot of creative parallels to the debut what we have here again is an onslaught of over a dozen tracks that are a very Punchy and cut to the chase Fusion of techno and fuzzy Lo-Fi Electro pop pretty much everything you need and nothing you don't on all these two to three minute Cuts driving beats very grainy and somewhat distorted but sweet synth leads Ghostly and surreal disorienting effects haunting and infectious lead vocals as well and when you're not getting a a clean straightforward lead on a track often there will be vocal samples or vocal chops that are arranged in such a way where it's Snappy when reading into snow strippers I was catching a lot of comparisons to Indie Electronica Darlings Crystal Castles which I wouldn't say is totally unwarranted but it's not a one-to-one comparison each Duo respectively has very different approaches to vocals plus snow strippers on this project show very little interest in embracing Punk or glitch Aesthetics though the 8-Bit synths on it's a dream did surprise me a bit while I don't think the comparison is super close I will say this I haven't heard something this visceral and this consistently good in the electro Clash Lane since Crystal Castles which may also be reason for the comparisons and it's fun money because I don't think snow strippers is doing anything especially flashy or novel and sometimes even skillful in this genre I mean being raw and maybe even a little sloppy in instances is the point look at the song sick for example whose mix is so loaded with bleed between the synthesizers and the delay soaked vocals and the bass then occasionally all of those sounds are overpowered by these random hits of robot vocals saying that's sick and then there's also the fragmented synth sequences on I'm on my own also the disorienting stops in the beat here and there on depriving you which are almost too unhinged so in addition to this record not being revolutionary it's also not a pursuit of perfectionism that's for sure however I still think the less is more fast and loose approach the duo applies to this project works in their favor as they pretty much deliver a series of infectious songs with very simple and effective ideas almost without fail for one track after another the tunes on these cuts are often so strong they shine through whatever chaos gram and Tatiana are subjecting them to with droning tones and psychedelic delays and suffocating hits of bass be that on your ridicule or it's going bad or fake smile in the opening track again all of which have lead vocal Melodies that are so strong they can't be killed with the weirdly claustrophobic mixes that we have on this mixtape which in a way I still think adds to the experience slightly because this record isn't A vibe it's not background music the beats and the bass and the volume here don't let up its borderline confrontational you have to engage with these songs they force you to dance with them cause yeah while the tunes are there sometimes the Beats on these tracks are enough like the shimmering synths and what sounds like side chained bass or Kicks On lacerate which gives the song This effect of like being woozy it's like the whole wave form of the song is throbbing as it's grooving along there's also the overwhelming Bliss of don't you feel where the slower meditative Tempo on this one enchants me then you have those futuristic woodwind sounding synths it's like something from another dimension and of course there's also the whooshing tones and rigid grooves of now it's not the same which is exactly the techno chaos I'm trying to get into and yeah a lot of this records appeal comes down to chaos but there are direct and catchy moments of clarity too be that on under your spell which has one of the most intelligible vocal Parts on the entire project that also goes for like to complicate too but overall this mixtape is kick ass it's good it's slightly one-dimensional in terms of its overall Vibe and sound there's not that much versatility to it at the end of the day but I still will say the dirty left field Aesthetics of this project are to its benefit even if there are moments where I wonder how much slightly cleaner production would improve its appeal there are a few tracks that feel redundant in the batch here and maybe a couple others where the rougher edges could have been smoothed out for a better overall experience the uzi track also ended up being one of the weaker spots here too but with all that being said I loved this thing I thought it was entertaining and a Non-Stop Groove Fest.
